    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic white Bai Mu Dan tea is caffeine free, certified Fairtrade and pairs well as a digestive after most foods. This is a premium tea that doesn't compare to mass produced commercial teas. It is considered the second highest grade of white tea after Silver Needle which starts at around $400/kg. For all but the most discerning tea enthusiasts Bai Mu Dan is the supreme white tea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Bai Mu Dan Tea?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bai Mu Dan, Bai Mudan or White Peony tea is a Chinese white tea. White Peony contains plucks of one leaf shoot and two young leaves each. It comes from the top two leaves and bud of each tea bush, which can be shade dried and/or lightly fired. This gives White Peony a pale cup color and delicate, nutty aroma. The complex flavor is toasty, slightly sweet and creamy, with a clean aftertaste.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Storage Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.</li>
<li>Store below 15°C and &lt; 65% humidity.</li>
<li>Store in the dark as light degrades flavors.</li>
<li>Mason jars make great storage containers.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our Spanish Mediterranean "Fleur de sel" has a high moisture content and retains a certain briny flavor from the sea. It's a delicate, almost flaky salt. Additionally, this moisture content encourages the salt crystals to stick together on your tongue, causing the flavor to be perceived more intensely. That's another reason a little bit goes a long way. But it's not necessarily more salty than any other sea salt.</p>
<p>It has a coarse yet light texture as it forms in flakes rather than grains like all other salts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is "Fleur de sel"?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Also called "Flower of salt" or "flor de sal" it is produced by a complicated process. It involves collecting the thin layer of salt that rises to the surface of shallow pools of seawater along the coast of the Mediterranean sea and Atlantic ocean.</li>
<li>Because it forms naturally under certain very limited weather conditions, and because it must be skimmed off by hand using special sieves, fleur de sel is, by any estimation, an extremely expensive product.</li>
<li>This makes sense if you think about how fleur de sel differs from ordinary sea salt. Ordinary sea salt is made by evaporating seawater and then collecting the remaining salt into mounds.</li>
<li>This high cost means that it shouldn't be used as an ordinary seasoning. Instead, think of it as almost a garnish or condiment. A few crystals of fleur de sel sprinkled over a dish add a burst of flavor, visual appeal, and even texture. A little bit truly goes a long way.</li>
<li>Once you've procured a stash of fleur de sel, you will want to use it carefully. For one thing, it is very delicate and will quickly dissolve, so it really should be added to a dish immediately before serving. You'll still taste it after it dissolves, but you won't see it or feel its distinctive texture.</li>
</ul>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic white sushi rice is a dedicated sticky rice especially grown for making sushi. You will get optimal sushi results with this rice which when cooked is soft and sticky and keeps its shape. It has more taste the more you chew, and also has a sweetness to it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What Type of Rice is Sushi Rice?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Long-grain rice, such as Basmati or Jasmine tends to have a dry fluffy texture and the grains don’t stick together thanks to a high ratio of Amylose to Amylopectin. This also causes long-grain rice to get hard as it cools. Short grain rice, on the other hand, has a higher ratio of Amylopectin to Amylose. This not only makes the rice sticky, but it also helps keep the rice soft, even after cooling.</li>
<li>There are many different kinds of short and medium grain rice, but if you’re planning on making sushi, getting a dedicated sushi rice will help you get a better outcome at making good sushi.</li>
<li>Our organic medium grain sushi rice is the only recommended sushi rice we carry. Using our short grain Arborio rice for sushi will not give good results as starch structures at the core of an Arborio grain deform, making for a firm, toothy center when cooked. While this trait is great for risotto as it gives the dish its signature al dente texture it’s less than ideal for sushi.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between brown, red, black and white rice?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brown, red and black rice are whole grain rice. That means they contain all parts of the grain, including the fibrous bran, the nutritious germ and the carb-rich endosperm.</li>
<li>White rice, on the other hand, has had the bran and germ removed, which are the most nutritious parts of the grain.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are your different types of rice?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Ancient Black Rice</em> (Black):
<ul>
<li>Origin: China</li>
<li>Type: Short grain rice</li>
<li>Fragrance: Nutty, earthy flavor and a very subtle, slightly sweet interior.</li>
<li>Features: Also called "Forbidden Rice", this is a special Chinese rice that is very nutritious.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic red jasmine rice also known as Thai red rice is deeply pigmented and contains an impressive array of nutrients and beneficial plant compounds. This type of rice is higher in protein and fiber than white rice varieties, but where it really shines is in its antioxidant content. Like black rice, it’s packed with flavonoid antioxidants, including the anthocyanins apigenin, myricetin, and quercetin. In fact, research shows that red jasmine rice has significantly more potential to fight free radicals and contains higher concentrations of flavonoid antioxidants than brown rice.</p>
<p>Jasmine rice get its pleasant popcorn-like smell from presence of a molecule called 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline that is present in this rice variety.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between brown, red, black and white rice?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brown, red and black rice are whole grain rice. That means they contain all parts of the grain, including the fibrous bran, the nutritious germ and the carb-rich endosperm.</li>
<li>White rice, on the other hand, has had the bran and germ removed, which are the most nutritious parts of the grain.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic jade pearl rice is nutritionally dense and provides a high amount of protein, fiber and chlorophyll. The stems and leaves of the bamboo plant are juiced to retain the chlorophyll and then this extract is added to the rice during the milling process. This is what gives the rice the extra nutritional value and its gorgeous jade green color.</p>
<p>It makes an exquisite plate presentation for dishes such as an Asian risotto, sushi, rice pudding, stir-fry recipes, soups and rice balls. It can also bring the presentation of a meal up to the next level by adding it as a side dish beside anything else. You’ll love the texture, aroma, flavor and visual appeal of this rice and you’ll find that it can be incorporated into many other recipes that call for plain white rice.</p>

<p><strong>What is Jade Pearl Rice?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Jade Pearl Rice is the trademarked name for an organic pearled short-grain rice infused with a bamboo extract. Grown in the forests of South Central Chin, Jade Pearl Rice has a pale jade color, an aroma of a bamboo forest, and a very faint vanilla taste.</li>
<li>Although the rice is touted as the perfect rice for a dessert pudding (and it is ideal for rice pudding), Jade Pearl Rice is also excellent as part of a main course for lunch or dinner.</li>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Ancient Black Rice?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Ancient black rice is a short grained very dark purple Chinese rice commonly referred to as "forbidden rice" because of its long and interesting history. As you probably know, all rice varieties are a substantial and important crop in the diet of nearly every Asian population, and have been for thousands of years. In China, black rice has been known for being good for the kidneys, stomach and liver since ancient times.</li>
<li>Thousands of years ago in ancient China, noble Chinese men took possession of every grain of the black forbidden rice, banning its consumption among anyone who was not royalty or very wealthy.</li>
<li>The crop was only grown in very limited quantities, closely monitored, and reserved for only the highest elite class. The common Chinese people were not allowed to grow or consume this black forbidden rice, which led to its unique name that it still carries with it today.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Volcano Rice?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Volcano Rice is a mineral and antioxidant packed blend of traditional brown and red rice grown on volcanic soils rich in magnesium, manganese and zinc. It contains brown rice, whole grain red rice and lightly milled red rice reputed to restore vitality due to its high mineral, fiber and antioxidant content.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between brown, red, black and white rice?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brown, red and black rice are whole grain rice. That means they contain all parts of the grain, including the fibrous bran, the nutritious germ and the carb-rich endosperm.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic ancient black rice is the type of rice that is richest in powerful disease-fighting antioxidants, but it also contains dietary fiber, anti-inflammatory properties. One serving of black or forbidden rice contains only around 160 calories, but offers a very high amount of flavonoid phytonutrients, a good source of important fiber, substantial mineral content including iron and copper, and even a good source of plant based protein. Just the outside hull of the grain has one of the highest levels of anthocyanin antioxidants of any food!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Ancient Black Rice?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Ancient black rice is a short grained very dark purple Chinese rice commonly referred to as "forbidden rice" because of its long and interesting history. As you probably know, all rice varieties are a substantial and important crop in the diet of nearly every Asian population, and have been for thousands of years. In China, black rice has been known for being good for the kidneys, stomach and liver since ancient times.</li>
<li>Thousands of years ago in ancient China, noble Chinese men took possession of every grain of the black forbidden rice, banning its consumption among anyone who was not royalty or very wealthy.</li>
<li>The crop was only grown in very limited quantities, closely monitored, and reserved for only the highest elite class. The common Chinese people were not allowed to grow or consume this black forbidden rice, which led to its unique name that it still carries with it today.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between brown, red, black and white rice?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brown, red and black rice are whole grain rice. That means they contain all parts of the grain, including the fibrous bran, the nutritious germ and the carb-rich endosperm.</li>
<li>White rice, on the other hand, has had the bran and germ removed, which are the most nutritious parts of the grain.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are your different types of rice?</strong></p>
<ul>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic dried apple rings look like lightly-browned, thinly-sliced versions of fresh apples. They are naturally sweet, making them a great-tasting snack alternative to fresh apples. Think of them as fruit chips in snack-size portions. The dehydrating process retains the apples original nutritional value. They will have the same calorie, protein, fat, carbohydrate, fiber, and sugar content as the fresh fruit.</p>
<p>Some people have the misconception that dried fruits are not as healthy as fresh ones. This is a myth that truly needs to be busted. It’s because dried fruits such as apples also offer a lot of health benefits for everyone. One of the benefits of dried apples is that it packs a high amount of both soluble and insoluble fiber. Half a cup of dried apples already gives you approximately 3-4 grams of dietary fiber, sufficient to cover 13-20% of your daily fiber requirements.</p>
<p>Organic dried apples are a rich source of antioxidants, especially polyphenols. These are substances that help fight off damage to your cells caused by free radicals. Polyphenols are antioxidants that help damaged cells regenerate themselves. They can neutralize free radicals by replacing the electrons stolen from the cells. Polyphenols also help in reducing the number of free radicals that enter the body.</p>
<p>They also contain two essential B-vitamins that promote energy metabolism, improve hormonal balance, and nourish the brain. They are pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Pantothenic acid is responsible for helping your body create energy from the food you eat. It is also vital in hormone production. Dried apples contain approximately 3% of your recommended daily intake of the vitamin. Pyridoxine is a B-vitamin that aids in metabolizing proteins and helps in creating neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are chemical transmitters in the brain that improve brain response and function. Dried apples can cover around 6% of your recommended daily pyridoxine intake.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic yacon powder is a super sweetener with powerful health benefits. When extracted and used in powdered form, yacon root is a low glycemic natural sweetener, meaning it doesn’t cause a spike in blood sugar. Yacon has some slightly sweet, resinous, and floral (similar to violet) undertones.</p>

<p><strong>What is Yacon?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yacon is a perennial root vegetable that looks something like a sweet potato. Yacon root grows naturally in South America and is known for being both sweet and filling.</li>
<li>Yacon root contains good carbohydrates known as fructoogliosaccharides (FOS). FOS are insoluble fibers or prebiotics that our bodies can’t digest. That might sound like a bad thing, but it’s actually the reason they’re so good for us. They make us feel full without adding calories.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic tapioca starch powder also known as tapioca flour is a good ingredient to have for all your gluten-free baking. It provides a crispy crust and chewy texture in gluten free baked goods. It also serves as an effective thickening agent for other recipes such as homemade pudding, cookie dough, sauces and gravies. Some people choose tapioca because they cannot eat corn or potatoes for health reasons and tapioca flour is a wonderful alternative.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is tapioca starch?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tapioca is a starch extracted from cassava root, a tuber native to South America. The cassava root is relatively easy to grow and a dietary staple in several countries in Africa, Asia, and South America.</li>
<li>It is made by squeezing starchy liquid out of ground cassava root. Once the starchy liquid is out, the water is allowed to evaporate. When all the water has evaporated, a fine tapioca powder is left behind.</li>
<li>It’s naturally gluten-free, so it can serve as a wheat substitute in cooking and baking for people who are on a gluten-free diet.</li>
<li>One of the main uses for tapioca starch is as a thickener in a variety of recipes because it absorbs water effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between arrowroot starch, tapioca starch and potato starch?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First of all 3 starches are extracted from their respective plants. This means that little to none of the plant's nutritional value if left behind.</li>
<li>They are all are root/tuber starches and don't handle heat very well. When using them in stews and soups, add them at the very end.</li>
<li>Arrowroot starch is the same weight by volume than potato starch. Unlike tapioca it handles acidic liquids (such as pie fillings) very well.</li>
<li>Tapioca starch is a lighter starch than potato starch. Use twice as much by volume when replacing potato starch in a recipe. It does not handle acidic liquids well and may lose its thickening ability when combined with them. Tapioca starch's strength in in baking application where it is mixes in with gluten-free flours to make gluten-free cookies, muffins and bread.</li>
<li>Potato starch is the baseline of root/tuber starches. It is a good starch to use if you are baking something you want to be crispy. Unlike tapioca it handles acidic liquids (such as pie fillings) very well.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic stevia leaf powder is the most natural stevia you can get. Made by simply grinding dried stevia leaves into a powder it can be added to all your recipes to cut down on calories while being more natural than white refined stevia found in grocery stores.</p>
<p><strong>Use <u>1/4 of a teaspoon</u> of stevia leaf powder for every <u>1 tablespoon</u> of sugar.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Stevia Leaf Powder?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Stevia leaf powder comes from leaves of the plant species "Stevia rebaudiana", native to Brazil and Paraguay.</li>
<li>The active compounds are steviol glycosides (mainly stevioside and rebaudioside), which have 30 to 150 times the sweetness of sugar, are heat-stable, pH-stable, and not fermentable. The human body does not metabolize the glycosides in stevia, so it contains zero calories.</li>
<li>Stevia's taste has a slower onset and longer duration than that of sugar, and at high concentrations some of its extracts may have an aftertaste described as licorice-like or bitter.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stevia vs Stevia Leaf Powder?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Stevia and stevia leaf powder might sound alike but are not at all the same.</li>
<li>Stevia, the white powder sold as an alternative sweetener is made from refined stevia leaf powder. It is stripped of most of its nutrients and kept only for its sweetening effect.</li>
<li>Stevia leaf powder is simply dried pure stevia leaves ground up into a powder. It tastes sweet like refined stevia but less intense and has a lot more nutrients.</li>
<li>As an example 100g of organic stevia leaf powder can sweeten around 6kg of protein powder. In contrast a 100g of refined stevia sweeten around 40-60kg of protein powder.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cyanobacteria, through the process of photosynthesis, converts sunlight into nearly all essential nutrients. It usually grows in warm, open lakes with high alkalinity. The concentration of protein and vitamins in Spirulina has led many to classify it as the "most nutrient dense food on the planet". Compared to other foods gram for gram, it lives up to this reputation.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic spinach powder is packed with beta-carotene. Carotenoids have many functions in the human body, but they are probably best known for their eye health protecting properties. When fresh spinach is dehydrated to make spinach powder, iron content of spinach becomes extremely concentrated, making spinach powder an excellent natural source of plant-based iron.</p>
<p>Fresh spinach is naturally high in fiber, and dehydration preserves the full dietary fiber content of spinach, ensuring spinach powder remains a good high-fiber food choice. Dietary fiber is important to your health because it provides bulk in your digestive tract and encourages the movement of food through your body, preventing constipation and speeding up the passage of waste through your bowels. According to research, diets high in fiber may also help you lose weight loss, lower your blood pressure, and fight insulin resistance.</p>
