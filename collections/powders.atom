    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic yacon powder is a super sweetener with powerful health benefits. When extracted and used in powdered form, yacon root is a low glycemic natural sweetener, meaning it doesn’t cause a spike in blood sugar. Yacon has some slightly sweet, resinous, and floral (similar to violet) undertones.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Yacon?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yacon is a perennial root vegetable that looks something like a sweet potato. Yacon root grows naturally in South America and is known for being both sweet and filling.</li>
<li>Yacon root contains good carbohydrates known as fructoogliosaccharides (FOS). FOS are insoluble fibers or prebiotics that our bodies can’t digest. That might sound like a bad thing, but it’s actually the reason they’re so good for us. They make us feel full without adding calories.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Storage Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.</li>
<li>Store below 15°C and &lt; 65% humidity.</li>
<li>Store in the dark as light degrades flavors.</li>
<li>Mason jars make great storage containers.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic tapioca starch powder also known as tapioca flour is a good ingredient to have for all your gluten-free baking. It provides a crispy crust and chewy texture in gluten free baked goods. It also serves as an effective thickening agent for other recipes such as homemade pudding, cookie dough, sauces and gravies. Some people choose tapioca because they cannot eat corn or potatoes for health reasons and tapioca flour is a wonderful alternative.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is tapioca starch?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tapioca is a starch extracted from cassava root, a tuber native to South America. The cassava root is relatively easy to grow and a dietary staple in several countries in Africa, Asia, and South America.</li>
<li>It is made by squeezing starchy liquid out of ground cassava root. Once the starchy liquid is out, the water is allowed to evaporate. When all the water has evaporated, a fine tapioca powder is left behind.</li>
<li>It’s naturally gluten-free, so it can serve as a wheat substitute in cooking and baking for people who are on a gluten-free diet.</li>
<li>One of the main uses for tapioca starch is as a thickener in a variety of recipes because it absorbs water effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between arrowroot starch, tapioca starch and potato starch?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First of all 3 starches are extracted from their respective plants. This means that little to none of the plant's nutritional value if left behind.</li>
<li>They are all are root/tuber starches and don't handle heat very well. When using them in stews and soups, add them at the very end.</li>
<li>Arrowroot starch is the same weight by volume than potato starch. Unlike tapioca it handles acidic liquids (such as pie fillings) very well.</li>
<li>Tapioca starch is a lighter starch than potato starch. Use twice as much by volume when replacing potato starch in a recipe. It does not handle acidic liquids well and may lose its thickening ability when combined with them. Tapioca starch's strength in in baking application where it is mixes in with gluten-free flours to make gluten-free cookies, muffins and bread.</li>
<li>Potato starch is the baseline of root/tuber starches. It is a good starch to use if you are baking something you want to be crispy. Unlike tapioca it handles acidic liquids (such as pie fillings) very well.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic stevia leaf powder is the most natural stevia you can get. Made by simply grinding dried stevia leaves into a powder it can be added to all your recipes to cut down on calories while being more natural than white refined stevia found in grocery stores.</p>
<p><strong>Use <u>1/4 of a teaspoon</u> of stevia leaf powder for every <u>1 tablespoon</u> of sugar.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Stevia Leaf Powder?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Stevia leaf powder comes from leaves of the plant species "Stevia rebaudiana", native to Brazil and Paraguay.</li>
<li>The active compounds are steviol glycosides (mainly stevioside and rebaudioside), which have 30 to 150 times the sweetness of sugar, are heat-stable, pH-stable, and not fermentable. The human body does not metabolize the glycosides in stevia, so it contains zero calories.</li>
<li>Stevia's taste has a slower onset and longer duration than that of sugar, and at high concentrations some of its extracts may have an aftertaste described as licorice-like or bitter.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stevia vs Stevia Leaf Powder?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Stevia and stevia leaf powder might sound alike but are not at all the same.</li>
<li>Stevia, the white powder sold as an alternative sweetener is made from refined stevia leaf powder. It is stripped of most of its nutrients and kept only for its sweetening effect.</li>
<li>Stevia leaf powder is simply dried pure stevia leaves ground up into a powder. It tastes sweet like refined stevia but less intense and has a lot more nutrients.</li>
<li>As an example 100g of organic stevia leaf powder can sweeten around 6kg of protein powder. In contrast a 100g of refined stevia sweeten around 40-60kg of protein powder.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Storage Tips:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Nothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.</li>
<li>Store below 15°C and &lt; 65% humidity.</li>
<li>Store in the dark as light degrades flavors.</li>
<li>Mason jars make great storage containers.</li>
<li>Can be frozen to prolong shelf life.</li>

It is also rich in phenolic acids, tocopherols and γ-linolenic acid. Spirulina lacks cellulose cell walls and therefore it can be easily digested.</p>
<p>The cyanobacteria, through the process of photosynthesis, converts sunlight into nearly all essential nutrients. It usually grows in warm, open lakes with high alkalinity. The concentration of protein and vitamins in Spirulina has led many to classify it as the "most nutrient dense food on the planet". Compared to other foods gram for gram, it lives up to this reputation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is spirulina?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Spirulina is a microscopic and filamentous cyanobacterium that derives its name from the spiral or helical nature of its filaments. It has a long history of use as food and it has been reported that it has been used during the Aztec civilization.</li>
<li>Spirulina refers to the dried biomass of Arthrospira platensis, an oxygenic photosynthetic bacterium found worldwide in fresh and marine waters. This alga represents an important staple diet in humans and has been used as a source of protein and vitamin supplement in humans without any significant side-effects.</li>
<li>It became internationally famous after it was successfully used by NASA as a dietary supplement for astronauts on space missions.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic spinach powder is packed with beta-carotene. Carotenoids have many functions in the human body, but they are probably best known for their eye health protecting properties. When fresh spinach is dehydrated to make spinach powder, iron content of spinach becomes extremely concentrated, making spinach powder an excellent natural source of plant-based iron.</p>
<p>Fresh spinach is naturally high in fiber, and dehydration preserves the full dietary fiber content of spinach, ensuring spinach powder remains a good high-fiber food choice. Dietary fiber is important to your health because it provides bulk in your digestive tract and encourages the movement of food through your body, preventing constipation and speeding up the passage of waste through your bowels. According to research, diets high in fiber may also help you lose weight loss, lower your blood pressure, and fight insulin resistance.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic raw sunflower seed 53% protein powder is fantastic for supporting muscle growth. In part due to its branched chain amino acid (BCAA) content, sunflower seed protein supports muscle growth and recovery, especially after a workout. Branched chain amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, and valine have been shown to likely increase muscle protein synthesis after resistance exercise. In addition to the BCAAs, sunflower seed protein also contains magnesium, an essential nutrient for muscle recovery and proper muscle functioning. To optimize muscle growth, it’s important to consume protein consistently throughout the day. Sunflower protein powder can be a great protein option on-the-go to help meet daily protein needs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between sunflower seed powder and sunflower seed protein powder?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sunflower seed powder is made by simply grinding sunflower seeds into a powder. It contains all the parts of the sunflower seed.</li>
<li>Sunflower seed protein powder is made by cold pressing the sunflower seeds to remove the oil. The result is a much higher protein to weight ratio and much less fat.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic soybean 90% protein powder or simply soy protein is the purest plant protein on the market. At 90% protein you can use soy protein to help you lose weight, boost energy, or build muscle. Soy protein is a complete protein with all nine essential amino acids. It is also a big winner over whey protein when it comes to sustainability. Growing soy for protein is much less environmentally damaging than growing crops to feed cows to make milk to make whey protein.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between soybean powder and soybean protein powder?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Soybean powder and flour is made by simply grinding soybeans into a powder. It contains all the parts of the soybean.</li>
<li>Soybean protein powder is made washing the soybeans in hot water to remove sugar and dietary fiber. The result is a much higher protein to weight ratio and much less fat.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic white quinoa 35% protein powder is naturally gluten-free and quinoa contains all of the essential amino acids to make it a complete protein source. This protein combines well with other proteins, such as sunflower protein, and it also combines well with other enzymes to aid in the digestive process. Quinoa protein generally has a neutral flavor that is easily masked, which makes it a good additive to things like shakes that do not have a heavy flavor. It blends well with other veggies and fruit flavor.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic fermented pea 80% protein powder is an excellent plant-based source of protein, extracted through an extensive process. After the harvest, peas are dried and grinded into a fine flour, then mixed with water, fermented, and separated from the fiber and starch. The paste is dried and ground into powder. Fermentation massively increases the "good" bacteria and promotes a healthy gut.</p>
<p>Fermented pea protein is readily digestible, making it a high quality protein source for those looking to include more plant protein in their lives. It’s a great flexitarian food, perfect for vegans and omnivores alike. It’s also an allergen-friendly alternative for those who can’t or choose not to consume dairy, soy or nuts.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic brown rice 80% protein powder is particularly high in cysteine, which can help enhance lung health, boost sports performance and promote the body’s detoxification process. It is also a source of methionine, which is essential for the synthesis of proteins and many other biomolecules required for survival.</p>
<p>For those looking to build muscle mass, brown rice protein can also deliver similar muscle-building results as whey. For a 2013 study published in Nutrition Journal, researchers at the University of Tampa gave athletes rice protein after resistance exercise over the course of eight weeks. At the end of the study, the athletes had an increase in lean body mass, decrease in fat-mass, increase in skeletal muscle growth and increased power and strength in ways that were comparable to the results from whey protein supplementation. Researchers concluded the effects of rice protein were very comparable to those of whey protein.</p>
<p>Not only is brown rice protein supplementation great for muscle building and recovery, it is also beneficial to people looking to lose weight, as brown rice has a "thermic effect". This means brown rice protein creates heat in the body through the process of digestion. Since lean proteins like brown rice protein take a lot of energy to digest, the body is burning calories long after the protein is consumed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between brown rice flour and brown price protein powder?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of the most common misconceptions out there is that rice protein is the same as rice flour and therefore high in carbs. In reality, it’s not.</li>
<li>Rice protein is not just ground up rice (i.e. rice flour). Rice protein is a product derived from brown rice.</li>
<li>To make rice protein, the brown rice grains are ground up into a fine powder and then treated with enzymes. The enzymes help to break apart and separate the starch (carbs) and after most of the starch content has been removed, the remaining product is now concentrated protein.</li>
<li>The starch is not wasted, it is actually used to make brown rice syrup.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic potato starch powder is a good ingredient to have for all your gluten-free baking. It is primarily used in canned soups and in blends where its thickening power is exploited, especially for fill viscosity. It is also used as a base for gelling agents in confections, for thickeners in products like pastry and pie fillings, and in instant puddings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is potato starch?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Potato starch is the starch found in potatoes. Starch potatoes "Solanum tuberosum" are different from regular potatoes that are commonly eaten.</li>
<li>The cells of the potatoes contain leucoplasts (starch grains). To extract the starch, the potatoes are crushed, and the starch grains are released from the destroyed cells. The starch is then washed out and dried to powder.</li>
<li>Starch itself is an odorless, tasteless, soft white substance that is made by all green plants.</li>
<li>One of the main uses for potato starch is as a thickener in a variety of recipes because it absorbs water effectively.</li>
<li>The rise of gluten-free baking has led to the rise of the use of potato starch.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between arrowroot starch, tapioca starch and potato starch?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First of all 3 starches are extracted from their respective plants. This means that little to none of the plant's nutritional value if left behind.</li>
<li>They are all are root/tuber starches and don't handle heat very well. When using them in stews and soups, add them at the very end.</li>
<li>Arrowroot starch is the same weight by volume than potato starch. Unlike tapioca it handles acidic liquids (such as pie fillings) very well.</li>
<li>Tapioca starch is a lighter starch than potato starch. Use twice as much by volume when replacing potato starch in a recipe. It does not handle acidic liquids well and may lose its thickening ability when combined with them. Tapioca starch's strength in in baking application where it is mixes in with gluten-free flours to make gluten-free cookies, muffins and bread.</li>
<li>Potato starch is the baseline of root/tuber starches. It is a good starch to use if you are baking something you want to be crispy. Unlike tapioca it handles acidic liquids (such as pie fillings) very well.</li>

This superfood has been used as a traditional remedy in phytomedicine and ayurvedic healing for thousands of years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is moringa?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moringa oleifera is a plant that is often called the drumstick tree, the miracle tree, the ben oil tree, or the horseradish tree.</li>
<li>It is native to areas of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. It is also grown in the tropics. The leaves, bark, flowers, fruit, seeds, and root are used to make medicine.</li>
<li>Moringa has been used for centuries due to its medicinal properties and health benefits. It also has antifungal, antiviral, antidepressant, and anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
<li>Moringa is an important food source in some parts of the world. Because it can be grown cheaply and easily, and the leaves retain lots of vitamins and minerals when dried, moringa is used in India and Africa in feeding programs to fight malnutrition. The immature green pods (drumsticks) are prepared similarly to green beans, while the seeds are removed from more mature pods and cooked like peas or roasted like nuts. The leaves are cooked and used like spinach, and they are also dried and powdered for use as a condiment.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic mesquite powder has the ability to balance blood sugar, making it a great option for diabetics. The sugar present in mesquite is fructose, which does not require insulin for metabolism. This helps maintain a steady blood sugar level for a sustained period of time. The glycemic index of mesquite is 25 (much lower than regular sugar) with a high percentage of dietary fiber. These factors allow it to digest much slower than many grains, preventing drastic spikes and dips in blood sugar.</p>
<p>Substitute mesquite powder for up to half of the regular flour in recipes, reducing (or eliminating) other sweeteners in the recipe based on personal preference. Starting out with a ratio of 25-30% mesquite flour is recommended. Mesquite can also be used in sauces and beverages in the same manner. It’s excellent in stews and soups, or to sweeten tea, coffee and smoothies. Perfect for raw food recipes as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is mesquite?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mesquite powder is made from the leguminous seed pods of the drought-tolerant mesquite plant, also known as algarrobo or algarroba. It can be used as a flour or a sweetener, and it has a sort of caramely, nutty flavor.</li>
