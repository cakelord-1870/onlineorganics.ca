    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic tapioca starch powder also known as tapioca flour is a good ingredient to have for all your gluten-free baking. It provides a crispy crust and chewy texture in gluten free baked goods. It also serves as an effective thickening agent for other recipes such as homemade pudding, cookie dough, sauces and gravies. Some people choose tapioca because they cannot eat corn or potatoes for health reasons and tapioca flour is a wonderful alternative.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is tapioca starch?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tapioca is a starch extracted from cassava root, a tuber native to South America. The cassava root is relatively easy to grow and a dietary staple in several countries in Africa, Asia, and South America.</li>
<li>It is made by squeezing starchy liquid out of ground cassava root. Once the starchy liquid is out, the water is allowed to evaporate. When all the water has evaporated, a fine tapioca powder is left behind.</li>
<li>It’s naturally gluten-free, so it can serve as a wheat substitute in cooking and baking for people who are on a gluten-free diet.</li>
<li>One of the main uses for tapioca starch is as a thickener in a variety of recipes because it absorbs water effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between arrowroot starch, tapioca starch and potato starch?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First of all 3 starches are extracted from their respective plants. This means that little to none of the plant's nutritional value if left behind.</li>
<li>They are all are root/tuber starches and don't handle heat very well. When using them in stews and soups, add them at the very end.</li>
<li>Arrowroot starch is the same weight by volume than potato starch. Unlike tapioca it handles acidic liquids (such as pie fillings) very well.</li>
<li>Tapioca starch is a lighter starch than potato starch. Use twice as much by volume when replacing potato starch in a recipe. It does not handle acidic liquids well and may lose its thickening ability when combined with them. Tapioca starch's strength in in baking application where it is mixes in with gluten-free flours to make gluten-free cookies, muffins and bread.</li>
<li>Potato starch is the baseline of root/tuber starches. It is a good starch to use if you are baking something you want to be crispy. Unlike tapioca it handles acidic liquids (such as pie fillings) very well.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Storage Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.</li>
<li>Store below 15°C and &lt; 65% humidity.</li>
<li>Store in the dark as light degrades flavors.</li>
<li>Mason jars make great storage containers.</li>
<li>Can be frozen to prolong shelf life.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic white quinoa flour is a tiny pseudocereal grown in the Andes. The seed is gluten-free and is considered a healthy food of the future. The United Nations listed quinoa as an Andean "superfood" and as a good alternative crop for food security and for helping in the fight against hunger.</p>
<p>An ancient grain, quinoa was first cultivated in the Andes about 7000 years ago and has been a staple diet since the pre-Columbian era. During the Spanish conquest, quinoa was neglected because it was considered an "Indian Food".</p>
<p>The last half of the 20th century saw a revival of quinoa cultivation. Today, its cultivation spreads the Andes region to Canada and the Northwest United States.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic millet flour is made from ground millet, a grain in the grass family that is grown as a crop in many parts of the world. Bakers often appreciate the flour’s light texture, and most find that it lends a certain sweet and nutty flavor to breads and other foods. Millet resembles wheat in both appearance and texture, but it is entirely gluten-free, which makes it popular with people who are avoiding gluten.</p>
<p>Millet is a whole grain, and many health experts claim that eating a diet rich in whole grains can help improve heart health and can contribute to a healthy weight. The grain is also a very good source of protein and iron, and is high in dietary fiber.</p>

You can use it in any recipe that calls for wheat flour, making baking and cooking gluten-free meals easy.</p>
<p>While sometimes the terms cassava flour and tapioca flour are used interchangeably, there are in fact distinct differences. Tapioca is a starch extracted from the cassava root through a process of washing and pulping. The wet pulp is then squeezed to extract a starchy liquid. Once all the water evaporates from the starchy liquid, the tapioca flour remains.</p>
<p>Alternatively, cassava flour is the whole root, simply peeled, dried and ground. This means it has more dietary fiber than tapioca flour.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic green banana flour is a powder made from peeled unripe bananas that are dried and ground. Commonly used in Haitian, Jamaican, West African, and Central American cooking, green banana flour can be used as any other grain-free flour, in anything from pastas to breads to cakes.</p>
<p>Straight from the container, green banana flour has a very mild banana flavor, and no flavor at all when cooked. If you’ve ever done any vegan baking you’re probably already familiar with the notion of subbing in mashed bananas for dairy-based fat like egg yolks and butter. Turns out, when in flour form, the fruit does a good job mimicking go to binding agents and thickeners like wheat flour.</p>

<p>Blanched almonds are almonds that have their brown skin removed. This gives a whiter flower with a less intense almond taste.</p>
<p>Almonds need really hot weather and cool winters to grow which limits their production to a very specific climate. They are 100% reliant on wild bees and honey bees for crop pollination (No bees, no almonds).</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic white unbleached sifted durum wheat flour is made by ''La Milanaise'' in Quebec from organic durum wheat. It is perfect to make pasta of to use as a dusting flour.</p>
<p>This flour is sifted which means it is neither white or brown but in between the two. The sifting process removes only a part of the bran.</p>
<p>Durum wheat, also called pasta wheat or macaroni wheat is the second most cultivated species of wheat after common wheat. Durum in Latin means "hard", and the species is the hardest of all wheats. This refers to the resistance of the grain to milling, in particular of the starchy endosperm, implying dough made from its flour is weak or "soft". This makes durum favorable for semolina and pasta.</p>
<p>This organic flour is specifically made to make pasta.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between beached and unbleached flour?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When flour is first milled, it has a yellowish cast that some consumers find unappealing. Within a few months of milling, however, these carotenoids, or pigments, in flour naturally whiten. Because it is expensive to naturally ''age'' flour, some producers expedite the process chemically.</li>
<li>In ''bleached'' flours, benzoyl peroxide is most commonly used to fade the yellow color. Organic standards prohibit the use of chemicals so none of our organic flours are bleached.</li>
<li>Cost is the only reason that pushes most commercial bakers to prefer bleached flours.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between white unbleached and sifted unbleached flour?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before the grains are milled into flour, white unbleached flour has the bran and germ removed.</li>
<li>Unbleached sifted white flour is milled whole just like whole brown flour. After milling it goes through a sifter that sifts out some of the bran. The result is a flour in between white and brown. It is healthier than white unbleached flour but still has a higher gluten content that whole flour making it a perfect balance for most bakery needs.</li>

<p>Red Fife is a wheat variety that was the baking and milling industries' standard of wheat in Canada from 1860 to 1900. The wheat was originally sent to Peterborough, Ontario farmer David Fife in 1840, from whom it took its name.

<p>Whole wheat Red Fife flour is made from whole grain Red Fife wheat and thus retains the nutrients found in whole grains. Whole grains have the 3 parts of the grain; The bran, endosperm and germ.</p>
<p>Whole grain flour health benefits come mainly from its high-fiber content. High-fiber grains help you with digestion, gut health, and weight management. The FDA even affirms that high-fiber, low-fat diets help reduce the risk of cancer and prevent coronary heart disease.</p>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between white unbleached and sifted unbleached flour?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before the grains are milled into flour, white unbleached flour has the bran and germ removed.</li>
<li>Unbleached sifted white flour is milled whole just like whole brown flour. After milling it goes through a sifter that sifts out some of the bran. The result is a flour in between white and brown. It is healthier than white unbleached flour but still has a higher gluten content that whole flour making it a perfect balance for most bakery needs.</li>

<p>To obtain organic Tipo ''00'' pizza flour, we first start with a rigorous wheat varietal selection process. The best varieties of organic wheat favoring the extensibility of the dough are selected. These varieties are crushed to obtain a flour that is extracted from the heart of the wheat kernel. It is a flour that has the characteristic of offering much more flexibility to the dough. Then, the organic Tipo 00 flour is sifted to remove the bran in order to obtain a white flour. Tipo ''00'' pizza flour does not undergo by any bleaching treatment. This sifted flour is sifted differently than our other sifted flours. It is not a whole flour sifted to remove some of the bran but instead an unbleached white flour sifted to make it very fine.</p>
<p>Our organic Tipo ''00'' pizza flour is perfect for Italian pizza lovers who enjoy long fermentation process. It give a nice crust and a well structured crumb. It is enriched to maximize its profile. The number ''00'' comes from the classification of the flour according to its ash content, its a way to classified the whiteness of the flour.</p>
