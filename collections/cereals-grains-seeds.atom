    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic hulled spelt also known as <em>''dinkel wheat''</em> or <em>''hulled wheat''</em>, is a species of wheat that has been cultivated since approximately 5000 BC.</p>
<p>Spelt was introduced to north America in the 1890s. In the 20th century, spelt was replaced by bread wheat in almost all areas where it was still grown. The organic farming movement revived its popularity somewhat toward the end of the century, as spelt requires less fertilizer. Since the beginning of the 21st century, spelt has become a common wheat substitute for making artisanal loaves of bread, kinds of pasta, and flakes.</p>
<p>Hulled spelt has just the inedible hull removed and is a whole grain. Whole grains have the 3 parts of the grain; The bran, endosperm and germ.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic farro refers to three ancient grains that have been around for thousands of years. They are ancient whole grains that originated in Mesopotamia. Whole grains have the 3 parts of the grain; The bran, endosperm and germ.</p>
<p>Before it’s cooked it looks similar to wheat berries, but afterward it looks similar to barley. It’s a small, light-brown grain with a noticeable outer layer of bran.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What does Farro mean?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contrary to popular belief, farro does not refer to one type of grain. Rather, it’s Italian for “ancient wheat grain” and often used to describe three different grains:</li>
<ul>
<li>Einkorn: ''Farro piccolo'' in Italian, known scientifically as <em>''Triticum monococcum''</em>.</li>
<li>Emmer: ''Farro medio'' in Italian, known scientifically as <em>''Triticum dicoccum''</em>.</li>
<li>Spelt: ''Farro grande'' in Italian, known scientifically as <em>''Triticum spelta''</em>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Emmer is by far the most common variety of farro. It is also considered higher quality for cooking than the other two grains and thus is sometimes called "true" Farro. Spelt is much more commonly grown in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic fine bulgur is an ancient grain that packs a nutritional punch into each nutty bite. The Old Testament mentions bulgur, and the wheat was popular in the ancient Mediterranean region. Bulgur mixes well with herbs and vegetables and is the main ingredient in popular Middle Eastern dishes such as tabbouleh (bulgur salad) and kibbeh (a kind of meatball). Bulgur does not require cooking. It can simply be soaked in water. It has a light nutty flavor.</p>
<p>Bulgur is made from whole grain wheat and thus retains the nutrients found in whole grains. Whole grains have the 3 parts of the grain; The bran, endosperm and germ.</p>
<p>Bulgur's health benefits come mainly from its high-fiber content as a whole grain. High-fiber grains help you with digestion, gut health, and weight management. The FDA even affirms that high-fiber, low-fat diets help reduce the risk of cancer and prevent coronary heart disease.</p>

This allows it to absorb liquid without falling apart, and distinguishes it from regular couscous and other pasta. Toasting also lends a distinctive, nutty flavor and satisfying texture.</p>
<p>Couscous is made from semolina, obtained by coarsely grinding the heart of robust wheat. Couscous makes an ideal stuffing for peppers, aubergines, and more. Couscous can also be used for sweets, by adding milk, raisins, or almonds.</p>

The fatty acids in pumpkin seeds contain a range of beneficial nutrients, such as sterols, squalene, and tocopherols.</p>
<p>They are a common ingredient in Mexican cuisine and are often eaten as a healthful snack. They are sometimes referred to as pepitas, Spanish for “little seed of squash.”</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic red clover seeds are the richest source of isoflavones, also known as phytoestrogens. The effect of these chemicals on a human body is similar to that of the hormone estrogen. Therefore, they are used in situations where a boost of this hormone can have a healing effect. In addition, isoflavones can replace natural estrogens, which can relieve some of the symptoms caused by this hormone, such as PMS and menopause.</p>
<p>Apart from being a natural estrogen booster, red clover seeds, or more specifically their sprouts, offer a great number of health benefits to both men and women.</p>
<p>Red clover seeds contain a great amount of protein (26%) that is easy to digest. They also provide your body with essential vitamins and minerals that you will be hard-pressed to find in any other food source, such as zinc, phosphorus, as well as vitamins K, E, and A.</p>
<p>Red clover sprouts are literally packed with antioxidants, which means that by eating them, you can slow down the process of aging and protect your body from the overall detrimental effect of free radicals.</p>

<p>Mung beans are also consumed sprouted, it’s important to note that sprouting changes their nutritional composition. Sprouted beans contain fewer calories and more free amino acids and antioxidants than unsprouted ones.</p>
<p>What’s more, sprouting reduces levels of phytic acid, which is an antinutrient. Antinutrients can reduce the absorption of minerals like zinc, magnesium and calcium.</p>

They’re rich in healthy fats, beneficial plant compounds and several vitamins and minerals. These nutrients may play a role in reducing your risk of common health problems, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Sunflower seeds are especially high in vitamin E and selenium. These function as antioxidants to protect your body’s cells against free radical damage, which plays a role in several chronic diseases.</p>
<p>When sunflower seeds are sprouted, their plant compounds increase. Sprouting also reduces factors that can interfere with mineral absorption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between our "Confectionary" grade sunflower seeds and "Bakery" grade sunflower seeds?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"Confectionery" sunflower seeds are derived from low-oil type of sunflower seeds and are easily recognizable for the greater size and striped whitish black color of the shell. The shape of confectionery grade kernels is flatter, thinner and longer than typical bakery grade type. Their taste is mild and color change after heat treatment is light brown.</li>
<li>"Bakery" sunflower seeds as you may have guessed are smaller and more oily. They are typically used exclusively for cooking. We carry exclusively "Confectionary" grade as it is the highest grade and can be used both for cooking and snacking.</li>
<li>Be wary of cheap organic sunflower seeds. They is a lot of different grades of sunflower seeds and some are not fit for human consumption.</li>

This mineral also helps your body utilize amino acids, fats, and carbs. They’re likewise high in copper, a mineral needed to make connective tissue and transport iron. Poppy seeds are used in baked goods and traditional dishes worldwide.</p>
<p>The poppy plant (<em>Papaver smoniferum</em>) has been used as a traditional remedy for centuries. Native to the Eastern Mediterranean, its flowers come in various colors, primarily white and yellow.</p>
<p>The poppy plant contains morphine, codeine, thebaine, and other opium alkaloids known for their pain-relieving, calming, and sleep-inducing properties. These compounds are often found in pharmaceutical drugs intended for these uses. These alkaloids are typically present in the poppy pod’s milky white liquid, also known as poppy latex. Poppy seeds don’t naturally contain opium compounds but may become contaminated with them during harvesting or as a result of pest damage. Thus, before after harvesting, poppy seeds are cleaned to get rid of any opium alkaloids with which they may have come into contact.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic hulled millet is a staple in many diets around the world, millet grew wild in Africa for centuries before being cultivated by man. In addition to being nutrient-rich, it grows well in cold, arid regions and can be harvested within 70 days of planting. While it has been primarily cultivated in Africa, Asia, and Europe, it is becoming more popular in the Western world.</p>
<p>Though technically a seed, millet offers similar health benefits to other grains and can be prepared in many of the same ways. It looks like little yellow pellets of bird seed (which is, in fact, one of the ways it is used) but it cooks up into a tender grain that has a mild corn flavor. It is both nutrient-rich and offers numerous heart-protective properties in addition to other benefits. Plus, it is something unique that can help add some flavor variety to your gluten free diet.</p>
<p>Many of the most powerful health benefits millet has to offer are related to its fiber content. For example, the high fiber levels found in millet may help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or “bad” cholesterol while boosting high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or “good” cholesterol. In addition to improving cholesterol levels, the fiber content of millet supports heart health by reducing blood pressure and, in doing so, reduces your risk for heart attack and stroke.</p>
<p>Our organic hulled millet is specifically of the Proso Millet variety (Panicum Miliaceum L.). Its color is light to golden yellow and the grains are 2-4mm in size.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic oat bran has a well-balanced nutritional composition. While it has similar amounts of carbs and fat as regular rolled oats, oat bran boasts more protein and fiber, and fewer calories. It is especially high in beta-glucan, a powerful type of soluble fiber.</p>
<p>Oats are widely regarded as one of the healthiest grains you can eat, as they’re packed with many important vitamins, minerals, and fiber.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between your Rolled Oats Flakes, Rolled Oats Flakes (Gluten-Free), Oat Bran, Oat Groats, &amp; Steel Cut Oats?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To start all Oats are gluten-free. The difference between all the forms of oats that we sell and the Rolled Oats (Gluten Free) is simple the extra level of precautions from cross-contamination. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unless you are extremely intolerant</span> to gluten you will never notice the difference. That is because although oats themselves don’t contain gluten, they’re often grown alongside other crops. The same equipment is typically used to harvest crops in neighboring fields, which leads a possibility of cross-contamination if one of those crops contains gluten.</li>
<li>The difference between steel cut oats and rolled oats lies in the manufacturing process. Steel cut oats are created when a full oat groat is sliced into pieces with steel. In contrast, rolled oats are flattened using large disks. This causes the oat to become flaky and soft, allowing them to absorb more liquid.</li>
<li>Oat groats are simply a whole oat grain just like steel cut oats and rolled oats. It is just not cut or rolled and is whole.</li>
<li>Oat bran is a piece of an oat groat, and oat bran is the outer layer of this oat groat, which is right underneath the inedible grain shell. It is very fibrous and ideal to add fiber to your diet.</li>

<p>Do to all of these “good-for-you” ingredients, oat groats offer quite a few health benefits. They can lower your blood pressure, and even help to prevent the onset of diabetes, which used with a whole-grain diet.</p>

<ul>
<li>To start all Oats are gluten-free. The difference between all the forms of oats that we sell and the Rolled Oats (Gluten Free) is simple the extra level of precautions from cross-contamination. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unless you are extremely intolerant</span> to gluten you will never notice the difference. That is because although oats themselves don’t contain gluten, they’re often grown alongside other crops. The same equipment is typically used to harvest crops in neighboring fields, which leads a possibility of cross-contamination if one of those crops contains gluten.</li>
<li>The difference between steel cut oats and rolled oats lies in the manufacturing process. Steel cut oats are created when a full oat groat is sliced into pieces with steel. In contrast, rolled oats are flattened using large disks. This causes the oat to become flaky and soft, allowing them to absorb more liquid.</li>
<li>Oat groats are simply a whole oat grain just like steel cut oats and rolled oats. It is just not cut or rolled and is whole.</li>
<li>Oat bran is a piece of an oat groat, and oat bran is the outer layer of this oat groat, which is right underneath the inedible grain shell. It is very fibrous and ideal to add fiber to your diet.</li>

<p>Steel cut oats are made by taking the oat groats and cutting them into 2 to 3 smaller pieces using a steel blade. Steel cut oats are also sometimes called Irish oats. Steel cut oats are also more coarse than other types of oats and tend to be chewier. This gives them a hearty texture that is very filling, but it does mean they require longer soaking and cooking times. However, they are still good to use in an overnight oats recipe.</p>

<p><strong>Do hemp seeds contain THC?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hemp seeds contain a trace amount of THC. It is so low that it has no effect whatsoever. The quantity requires to make any sort of effect would be impossible to eat.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will your hemp seeds grow if I plant them?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We never tried it. It is illegal to grow hemp in Canada without a license from the Industrial Hemp Regulations Program. We will not advise or encourage the growing of hemp and we will not sell our seeds to anyone that we suspect will use them for anything else than eating. This product is sold for end-user consumption only.</li>
