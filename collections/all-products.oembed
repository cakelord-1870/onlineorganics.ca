Think again. The rich fat content of cashews (mostly heart-healthy fats!) makes them a perfect substitute for heavy cream. To witness this almost magical transformation for yourself, soak a cup of raw cashews in 1\/2 cup water overnight; then, blend the mixture in a food processor until completely smooth, adding additional chilled water to reach the desired consistency. You’ll be astonished as to how rich and creamy the result is, and it’s nearly indistinguishable from dairy cream, but with a fraction of the fat and calories.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStorage Tips:\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStore below 15°C and \u0026lt; 65% humidity.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStore in the dark as light degrades flavors.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMason jars make great storage containers.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCan be frozen to prolong shelf life.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"OnlineOrganics","offers":[{"title":"1 kg (Vacuum Packed)","offer_id":36554453581985,"sku":"IMP-30062-R","price":19.61,"currency_code":"CAD","in_stock":true},{"title":"50 lb Wholesale Box (20% OFF)","offer_id":36554453614753,"sku":"IMP-30062-B22","price":356.47,"currency_code":"CAD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0498\/3190\/3393\/products\/organic-cashew-pieces-pile.jpg?v=1603291500"},{"product_id":"organic-chickpeas","title":"Organic Chickpeas","description":"\u003cp\u003eOur organic chickpeas are high in protein and make an excellent replacement for meat in vegetarian and vegan diets.

One cultural survey of Sicily from around 1154 mentions a precursor to spaghetti, dried strands of dough made from wheat flour, being exported to other regions of Italy. Another version called \u003cem\u003espaghetti alla chitarra\u003c\/em\u003e originated in Abruzzo, where it was first made using a tool similar to a guitar (chitarra means guitar). The dough was placed on the chitarra then pushed through so that the strings cut the sheet of dough into strips.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStrascinati:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRegion: Basilicata \u0026amp; Puglia (southern Italy)\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStrascinati are very similar to orecchiette, just larger.

For a syrup to make the grade, it must fall within the color range for that grade and have the proper flavor to match. Golden syrup must be light in color and have delicate flavor of maple. In cases where the flavor and color don’t match, the grade goes to the flavor or color that is darkest or strongest. For example, a syrup that has Golden color but a Dark flavor can’t be labeled as Golden, rather it is labeled as the Dark.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does grade A mean?\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are 3 grades of maple syrup Grade A, Processing Grade and Substandard.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGrade A quality of maple syrup:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHas not more than 68.9 percent solids content by weight (Brix).\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHas good uniform color.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHas good flavor and odor, and intensity of flavor (maple taste) normally associated with the color class.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIs free from off flavors and odors considered as damage.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIs free from cloudiness, turbidity, sediment, and is clean.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo deviants for damage shall be allowed in Grade A.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProcessing Grade is any maple syrup that does not meet Grade A requirements, but meets the requirement of Processing Grade for use in the manufacturing of other products.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProcessing Grade maple syrup cannot be packaged in consumer-size containers for retail sales (containers of less than 5 gallons).\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMay be any color class and any light transmittance; and not more than 68.9 percent solids content by weight (Brix).\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMay contain off flavors; and odors.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMay have a very strong taste.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSubstandard is the quality of maple syrup that fails to meet the requirements of\u003cbr\u003eProcessing Grade maple syrup.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is organic maple syrup?\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou are not alone, while most organic products are pretty easy to understand, organic maple syrup is more complex.

In reality organic maple syrup standards are more about eco-responsibility and sustainability.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOrganic maple syrup producers must ensure the presence of 15% companion species, which means at least 15% of the trees in their woodlot must not be maple.

Tubing to collect maple syrup must be installed with protectors to avoid damaging maple trees.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are limitations to the size of maple trees that organic maple syrup producers can tap, the trees must have a diameter larger than 20cm at chest height in order to be tapped.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe only disinfectant allowed, which ensures there are no bacteria in the tap hole when the tree is tapped, for organic maple syrup producers is food grade ethyl alcohol.

This cuts down on labor as well as fuel costs. Organic maple syrup producers must ensure that no mineral components of sap are removed during this process.
