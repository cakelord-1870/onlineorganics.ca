A cut is made on the flower of the coconut palm and the liquid sap is collected into containers. The sap is placed under heat until most of the water has evaporated.

Its color is similar to that of raw sugar, but the particle size is typically smaller or more variable.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoconut sugar does retain quite a bit of the nutrients found in the coconut palm.

For a 2013 study published in Nutrition Journal, researchers at the University of Tampa gave athletes rice protein after resistance exercise over the course of eight weeks. At the end of the study, the athletes had an increase in lean body mass, decrease in fat-mass, increase in skeletal muscle growth and increased power and strength in ways that were comparable to the results from whey protein supplementation. Researchers concluded the effects of rice protein were very comparable to those of whey protein.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only is brown rice protein supplementation great for muscle building and recovery, it is also beneficial to people looking to lose weight, as brown rice has a \"thermic effect\". This means brown rice protein creates heat in the body through the process of digestion. Since lean proteins like brown rice protein take a lot of energy to digest, the body is burning calories long after the protein is consumed.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the difference between brown rice flour and brown price protein powder?\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOne of the most common misconceptions out there is that rice protein is the same as rice flour and therefore high in carbs.
