Conventional yeast production, on the other hand, uses harsh acids, bases (like lye, also known as sodium hydroxide), synthetic vitamins, ammonia and ammonium salts, and anti-foaming agents. With certified organic yeast production, all the raw materials used are 100% organic, benefiting the entire organic supply chain. Going with organic yeast is better for the planet and a healthier choice for the consumer.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is yeast?\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYeast is a unicellular microorganism that has been used in production of various food and drinks for thousands of years. Today yeast is produced industrially for bakers, wine makers and many other applications. Yeast has specific nutrient requirements for growth. It needs a source of sugar and nitrogen as well as vitamins, minerals and trace elements.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSimply it is a organism that eats starches and sugars in the flour, turning them into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas. This gas inflates the network of air bubbles, causing the dough to rise. During rising, the yeast divides and multiplies, producing more carbon dioxide. As long as there is ample air and food (carbohydrates) in the dough, the yeast will multiply until its activity is stopped by the oven’s heat.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid you know?\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMost organic store bought and even bakery breads are made with conventional yeast\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor a long time, yeast was classified as a ''non-agricultural food substance'' on the ''National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances'' because no company was making organic yeast as its production method is very different.
