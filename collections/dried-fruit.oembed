This greatly speeds up the drying process and prevents them from becoming dark like \"Thompson\" raisins.

Dried apples contain approximately 3% of your recommended daily intake of the vitamin. Pyridoxine is a B-vitamin that aids in metabolizing proteins and helps in creating neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are chemical transmitters in the brain that improve brain response and function.
