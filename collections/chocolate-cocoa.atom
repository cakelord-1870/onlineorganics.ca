    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic raw carob powder is dried, roasted carob tree pods and looks a lot like cocoa powder. Carob powder is often used as a natural sweetener in baked goods. It’s sweet and has a unique taste. Often, no added sugar is needed when baking with carob as opposed to cocoa.</p>
<p>Carob powder contains no fat, no sodium, is high in fiber and gluten-free. It also contains no caffeine as opposed to cocoa so if you are especially sensitive to caffeine you can rest easy after eating carob.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Carob?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The carob is a flowering evergreen tree "Ceratonia siliqua" or shrub in the Caesalpinioideae sub-family of the legume family, Fabaceae. It is widely cultivated for its edible pods, and as an ornamental tree in gardens and landscapes.</li>
<li>It is native to the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. Portugal is the largest producer of carob, followed by Italy and Morocco.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Storage Tips:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Nothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.</li>
<li>Store below 15°C and &lt; 65% humidity.</li>
<li>Store in the dark as light degrades flavors.</li>
<li>Mason jars make great storage containers.</li>

<ul></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between Cocoa Paste, Cocoa Nibs, and Cocoa Butter?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cocoa paste is simply roasted cocoa beans ground up in a paste. Also called cocoa liquor or cocoa mass it is the basic ingredient to make chocolate. Cocoa paste contains about 40-50% cocoa butter.</li>
<li>Cocao nibs are small pieces of roasted cocoa beans. Their contents is the same as paste it is just in a different format</li>
<li>Cocoa butter is just the fat separated from the paste.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What does 38%, 55%, 70% and 100% mean?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It refers to the cocoa content in the chocolate. For example 70% cocoa is 70% of its mass in ground up cocoa beans. Be careful with products listing ''70% cocoa content'' as these inferior products have much lower cocoa bean percentage. Their ''cocoa content'' is often jacked with cocoa powder. A premium chocolate typically has very little or no cocoa powder. Its cocoa is purely in the form of cocoa beans. This is why some cheap chocolate products and chips feel dry and crumbly, there is too much added cocoa powder.</li>
<li>100% cocoa as the name implies is pure ground up cocoa beans without any added sugar or fillers. This is made purely for making chocolate and recipes as it is extremely bitter.</li>
<li>A higher ''%'' does not mean a higher quality, it is just the taste. Our 38% Belgian chocolate drops are very low in cocoa but taste like heaven.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic cocoa butter wafers 100%, also called theobroma oil is one of the most expensive natural fats. This is due to its unique melting behavior. Cocoa butter has a much narrower melting range than any other fat. This quality is fundamental to chocolate. Chocolate should be hard, even in hot weather and it should not stick to the fingers. At room temperature, about 70% of the triacylglycerols in cocoa butter are solid. On eating, the cocoa butter in the chocolate should melt completely in the mouth and cause a pleasant taste sensation due to the consumed melting enthalpy.</p>
<p>Our organic cocoa butter can be used in a variety of recipes as well as numerous beauty products. Praised for its high quality fatty acids, cocoa butter is used in premium hydrating creams and lip balms.</p>

<p><strong>What are the different chocolate shapes?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With premium chocolate comes specialized chocolate depending on the intended use.</li>
<li>Chocolate chips are intended for baking inside dough such as cookies, muffins, pancakes, etc. Chips dry out if melted in open air, as they were not designed to be melted.</li>
<li>Chocolate wafers or drops are made to be melted into molds, bars, etc. Their shape make them easy to melt and their composition is designed for that purpose. If you want to try to make your own gourmet chocolate, these are the way to go.</li>
<li>Chocolate couverture blocks are as the name implies blocks to be melted. You can always eat is as a giant chocolate bar, we won't judge. Some people genuinely like the texture of chunks. Couverture chocolate as the French word implies is formulated to cover things. This chocolate is what you want to use for chocolate fondue, chocolate covered fruits and nuts, etc. It is very malleable and wont crack even if is very thin over a product.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic chocolate chips 1000ct 70% are truly a godsend. The chocolate chips we sell have nothing to do with the one's found in your grocery store. These Peruvian chocolate chips have a nice dark color with 70% cocoa content.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What does the 1000ct (1M) or 4000ct (4M) mean?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ''ct'' refers to how many chips are contained in one pound. The higher the number, the smaller the chips</li>
<li>1000ct chocolate chips are about 10mm in diameter. These are the standard chips found in grocery stores.</li>
<li>4000ct chocolate chips are about 6mm in diameter. These are the more rare mini chips found in grocery stores.</li>

<p><strong>What does 38%, 55%, 70% and 100% mean?</strong></p>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between regular, semi-sweet and bittersweet?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Regular is pretty straightforward meaning the sugar content and bitterness are what you would normally expect from a chocolate bar.</li>
<li>Semi-sweet chocolate has sugar added, but less than what you would expect from regular chocolate. Our organic semi-sweet chocolate chips have 47% cocoa beans and 52.5% sugar.</li>
<li>Bittersweet has even less sugar added and is commonly called ''Baker's Chocolate''. Our bittersweet chocolate have around 52.2% cocoa beans and 47.3% sugar.</li>
<li>As you can see the differences between semi-sweet and bittersweet are marginal and can be used interchangeably in baking.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Storage Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.</li>
<li>Store below 15°C and &lt; 65% humidity.</li>

<li>Mason jars make great storage containers.</li>
<li>Can be frozen to prolong shelf life.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic cocoa powder 10-12% (7.3-7.8pH) is pure cocoa powder. The 7.3-7.8pH range is what is referred to as highly dutched cocoa powder or alkalized cocoa powder. This is what you would use for baking and drinks.</p>
<p><span data-mce-fragment="1">7.</span><span data-mce-fragment="1">3</span><span data-mce-fragment="1">-7.</span><span data-mce-fragment="1">8</span>pH is more neutral than natural coca powder (5-6.2pH) and reacts less when baked. It is washed in alkaline solution of potassium carbonate. This wash neutralizes their acidity. So, dutch-process cocoa powder is neutral. Because it is neutral, it does not react with baking soda. It's often paired with baking powder.</p>
<p>Alkalizing cocoa makes it darker in color, mellow in flavor, and dissolves easily into liquids. Oreo cookies are made from dutched cocoa!</p>
<p>This organic cocoa powder is made by Bensdorp (Barry Callebault) which makes most of our premium chocolates. Their St-Hyacinthe, QC factory is state-of-the-art and being less than 30km from their factory guarantees you the freshest products.</p>
<p>10-12% refers to the fat content in the powder. Sometimes spelled simply 10/12 cocoa powder is referred to as ''Low Fat'' which is the most popular percentage. The other less common cocoa powders are 20/22 and 22/24 referred to as ''High Fat''.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is cocoa powder?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When cocoa pods are harvested from the trees, cocoa beans are removed from the pods, fermented, and dried. Then dried beans are roasted to develop the flavor and aroma of the cocoa. Roasted beans (cocoa nibs) are milled to create cocoa liquor, which is either conched to make chocolate products or pressed. Cocoa powder is the dry cocoa solids left after by pressing cocoa liquor to remove much of the cocoa butter.</li>
<li>In simple terms it is the byproduct of cocoa paste which is the base for chocolate.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Storage Tips:</strong></p>

<li>Nothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.</li>
<li>Store below 15°C and &lt; 65% humidity.</li>

<p>This organic cocoa powder is made by Bensdorp (Barry Callebault) which makes most of our premium chocolates. Their St-Hyacinthe, QC factory is state-of-the-art and being less than 30km from their factory guarantees you the freshest products.</p>
<p>10-12% refers to the fat content in the powder. Sometimes spelled simply 10/12 cocoa powder is referred to as "Low Fat" which is the most popular percentage. The other less common cocoa powders are 20/22 and 22/24 referred to as "High Fat".</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is cocoa powder?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When cocoa pods are harvested from the trees, cocoa beans are removed from the pods, fermented, and dried. Then dried beans are roasted to develop the flavor and aroma of the cocoa. Roasted beans (cocoa nibs) are milled to create cocoa liquor, which is either conched to make chocolate products or pressed. Cocoa powder is the dry cocoa solids left after by pressing cocoa liquor to remove much of the cocoa butter.</li>
<li>In simple terms it is the byproduct of cocoa paste which is the base for chocolate.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Storage Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.</li>
<li>Store below 15°C and &lt; 65% humidity.</li>
<li>Store in the dark as light degrades flavors.</li>
<li>Mason jars make great storage containers.</li>
<li>Can be frozen to prolong shelf life.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic cocoa paste wafers 100%, also called cocoa liquor wafers are truly unique. These Peruvian organic cocoa paste wafers are made with 100% cocoa paste. No sugar or additives for the purest form of cocoa possible.</p>
<p>Use them to craft your own artisanal chocolates. Please do not try to snack on them or bake them into cookies or muffins as they are very bitter on their own.</p>
<ul></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between Cocoa Paste, Cocoa Nibs, and Cocoa Butter?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cocoa paste is simply roasted cocoa beans ground up in a paste. Also called cocoa liquor or cocoa mass it is the basic ingredient to make chocolate. Cocoa paste contains about 40-50% cocoa butter.</li>
<li>Cocao nibs are small pieces of roasted cocoa beans. Their contents is the same as paste it is just in a different format</li>
<li>Cocoa butter is just the fat separated from the paste.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What does 38%, 55%, 70% and 100% mean?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It refers to the cocoa content in the chocolate. For example 70% cocoa is 70% of its mass in ground up cocoa beans. Be careful with products listing ''70% cocoa content'' as these inferior products have much lower cocoa bean percentage. Their ''cocoa content'' is often jacked with cocoa powder. A premium chocolate typically has very little or no cocoa powder. Its cocoa is purely in the form of cocoa beans. This is why some cheap chocolate products and chips feel dry and crumbly, there is too much added cocoa powder.</li>
<li>100% cocoa as the name implies is pure ground up cocoa beans without any added sugar or fillers. This is made purely for making chocolate and recipes as it is extremely bitter.</li>
<li>A higher ''%'' does not mean a higher quality, it is just the taste. Our 38% Belgian chocolate drops are very low in cocoa but taste like heaven.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are the different chocolate shapes?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With premium chocolate comes specialized chocolate depending on the intended use.</li>
<li>Chocolate chips are intended for baking inside dough such as cookies, muffins, pancakes, etc. Chips dry out if melted in open air, as they were not designed to be melted.</li>
<li>Chocolate wafers or drops are made to be melted into molds, bars, etc. Their shape make them easy to melt and their composition is designed for that purpose. If you want to try to make your own gourmet chocolate, these are the way to go.</li>
<li>Chocolate couverture blocks are as the name implies blocks to be melted. You can always eat is as a giant chocolate bar, we won't judge. Some people genuinely like the texture of chunks. Couverture chocolate as the French word implies is formulated to cover things. This chocolate is what you want to use for chocolate fondue, chocolate covered fruits and nuts, etc. It is very malleable and wont crack even if is very thin over a product.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Storage Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.</li>
<li>Store below 15°C and &lt; 65% humidity.</li>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between regular, semi-sweet and bittersweet?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Regular is pretty straightforward meaning the sugar content and bitterness are what you would normally expect from a chocolate bar.</li>
<li>Semi-sweet chocolate has sugar added, but less than what you would expect from regular chocolate. Our organic semi-sweet chocolate chips have 47% cocoa beans and 52.5% sugar.</li>
<li>Bittersweet has even less sugar added and is commonly called ''Baker's Chocolate''. Our bittersweet chocolate have around 52.2% cocoa beans and 47.3% sugar.</li>
<li>As you can see the differences between semi-sweet and bittersweet are marginal and can be used interchangeably in baking.</li>

<p><strong>What does 38%, 55%, 70% and 100% mean?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It refers to the cocoa content in the chocolate. For example 70% cocoa is 70% of its mass in ground up cocoa beans. Be careful with products listing ''70% cocoa content'' as these inferior products have much lower cocoa bean percentage. Their ''cocoa content'' is often jacked with cocoa powder. A premium chocolate typically has very little or no cocoa powder. Its cocoa is purely in the form of cocoa beans. This is why some cheap chocolate products and chips feel dry and crumbly, there is too much added cocoa powder.</li>
<li>100% cocoa as the name implies is pure ground up cocoa beans without any added sugar or fillers. This is made purely for making chocolate and recipes as it is extremely bitter.</li>
<li>A higher ''%'' does not mean a higher quality, it is just the taste. Our 38% Belgian chocolate drops are very low in cocoa but taste like heaven.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are the different chocolate shapes?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With premium chocolate comes specialized chocolate depending on the intended use.</li>
<li>Chocolate chips are intended for baking inside dough such as cookies, muffins, pancakes, etc. Chips dry out if melted in open air, as they were not designed to be melted.</li>
<li>Chocolate wafers or drops are made to be melted into molds, bars, etc. Their shape make them easy to melt and their composition is designed for that purpose. If you want to try to make your own gourmet chocolate, these are the way to go.</li>
<li>Chocolate couverture blocks are as the name implies blocks to be melted. You can always eat is as a giant chocolate bar, we won't judge. Some people genuinely like the texture of chunks. Couverture chocolate as the French word implies is formulated to cover things. This chocolate is what you want to use for chocolate fondue, chocolate covered fruits and nuts, etc. It is very malleable and wont crack even if is very thin over a product.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between regular, semi-sweet and bittersweet?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Regular is pretty straightforward meaning the sugar content and bitterness are what you would normally expect from a chocolate bar.</li>
<li>Semi-sweet chocolate has sugar added, but less than what you would expect from regular chocolate. Our organic semi-sweet chocolate chips have 47% cocoa beans and 52.5% sugar.</li>
<li>Bittersweet has even less sugar added and is commonly called ''Baker's Chocolate''. Our bittersweet chocolate have around 52.2% cocoa beans and 47.3% sugar.</li>
<li>As you can see the differences between semi-sweet and bittersweet are marginal and can be used interchangeably in baking.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Storage Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.</li>
<li>Store below 15°C and &lt; 65% humidity.</li>
<li>Store in the dark as light degrades flavors.</li>
<li>Mason jars make great storage containers.</li>
<li>Can be frozen to prolong shelf life.</li>

<li>A higher ''%'' does not mean a higher quality, it is just the taste. Our 38% Belgian chocolate drops are very low in cocoa but taste like heaven.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are the different chocolate shapes?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With premium chocolate comes specialized chocolate depending on the intended use.</li>
<li>Chocolate chips are intended for baking inside dough such as cookies, muffins, pancakes, etc. Chips dry out if melted in open air, as they were not designed to be melted.</li>
<li>Chocolate wafers or drops are made to be melted into molds, bars, etc. Their shape make them easy to melt and their composition is designed for that purpose. If you want to try to make your own gourmet chocolate, these are the way to go.</li>
<li>Chocolate couverture blocks are as the name implies blocks to be melted. You can always eat is as a giant chocolate bar, we won't judge. Some people genuinely like the texture of chunks. Couverture chocolate as the French word implies is formulated to cover things. This chocolate is what you want to use for chocolate fondue, chocolate covered fruits and nuts, etc. It is very malleable and wont crack even if is very thin over a product.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between regular, semi-sweet and bittersweet?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Regular is pretty straightforward meaning the sugar content and bitterness are what you would normally expect from a chocolate bar.</li>
<li>Semi-sweet chocolate has sugar added, but less than what you would expect from regular chocolate. Our organic semi-sweet chocolate chips have 47% cocoa beans and 52.5% sugar.</li>
<li>Bittersweet has even less sugar added and is commonly called ''Baker's Chocolate''. Our bittersweet chocolate have around 52.2% cocoa beans and 47.3% sugar.</li>
<li>As you can see the differences between semi-sweet and bittersweet are marginal and can be used interchangeably in baking.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Storage Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.</li>
<li>Store below 15°C and &lt; 65% humidity.</li>
<li>Store in the dark as light degrades flavors.</li>
<li>Mason jars make great storage containers.</li>
<li>Can be frozen to prolong shelf life.</li>
