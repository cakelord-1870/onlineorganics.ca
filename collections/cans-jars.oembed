Tomato paste is basically super-concentrated tomato sauce. If you take tomatoes and cook them down, strain the skin and seeds from the mixture and continue to cook the sauce down until it forms a thick consistency, you get tomato paste.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe benefit of using tomato paste over other canned tomatoes (like tomato puree, crushed tomatoes or diced tomatoes) or even fresh tomatoes, is that you get the deep tomato flavor without all the extra water, making it great for recipes where you don't want a ton of liquid, like meatloaf or taco filling. Tomato paste can be used to intensify flavor over time in slow-cooked recipes or can quickly add a burst of flavor in quick 30-minute recipes for weeknights. To get the most flavor potential out of your tomato paste, plan to add it early on in the cooking process before adding liquids like water, broth or other canned tomatoes. This way, the tomatoes have the chance to caramelize and develop even further.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"OnlineOrganics","offers":[{"title":"13.2 kg (6 x 2.2 kg) Box (20% OFF)","offer_id":37536889831585,"sku":"FAR-TO-BIO03-B13","price":125.4,"currency_code":"CAD","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0498\/3190\/3393\/products\/organic-italian-tomato-paste-pile.png?v=1610460951"},{"product_id":"organic-peeled-italian-tomatoes","title":"Organic Whole Peeled Italian Tomatoes in Tomato Juice","description":"\u003cp\u003eOur organic whole Italian peeled tomatoes undergo minimal heating, usually just the quick burst of steam necessary to remove the skins.
