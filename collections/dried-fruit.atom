    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic dried apple rings look like lightly-browned, thinly-sliced versions of fresh apples. They are naturally sweet, making them a great-tasting snack alternative to fresh apples. Think of them as fruit chips in snack-size portions. The dehydrating process retains the apples original nutritional value. They will have the same calorie, protein, fat, carbohydrate, fiber, and sugar content as the fresh fruit.</p>
<p>Some people have the misconception that dried fruits are not as healthy as fresh ones. This is a myth that truly needs to be busted. It’s because dried fruits such as apples also offer a lot of health benefits for everyone. One of the benefits of dried apples is that it packs a high amount of both soluble and insoluble fiber. Half a cup of dried apples already gives you approximately 3-4 grams of dietary fiber, sufficient to cover 13-20% of your daily fiber requirements.</p>
<p>Organic dried apples are a rich source of antioxidants, especially polyphenols. These are substances that help fight off damage to your cells caused by free radicals. Polyphenols are antioxidants that help damaged cells regenerate themselves. They can neutralize free radicals by replacing the electrons stolen from the cells. Polyphenols also help in reducing the number of free radicals that enter the body.</p>
<p>They also contain two essential B-vitamins that promote energy metabolism, improve hormonal balance, and nourish the brain. They are pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Pantothenic acid is responsible for helping your body create energy from the food you eat. It is also vital in hormone production. Dried apples contain approximately 3% of your recommended daily intake of the vitamin. Pyridoxine is a B-vitamin that aids in metabolizing proteins and helps in creating neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are chemical transmitters in the brain that improve brain response and function. Dried apples can cover around 6% of your recommended daily pyridoxine intake.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic dried Zante Currants are sun-dried from the Black Corinth grape, a very special variety red grape grown in select vineyards. For many, they’ve become the preferred delicacy in baked good recipes, like scones, cookies, breads, muffins and rolls. Zante Currants are actually raisins and not currants which grow in bushes instead of vines.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What is the difference between Thompson, Sultana, Flame raisins and Zante currants?</strong></p> <ul> <li>Both "Thompson" and "Sultana" raisins come from the same "Thompson Seedless" green grape variety.</li> <li>The difference between "Thompson" and "Sultana" raisins lies in how they are dried. "Thompson" raisins are sun dried without any additional processing. This takes up to 3 weeks and raises their cost. "Sultana" raisins are dipped in oil (organic vegetable oil or more typically organic olive oil) and laid out in the sun to dry. This greatly speeds up the drying process and prevents them from becoming dark like "Thompson" raisins. Their processing being more industrial they are less popular but equally delicious.</li> <li>Flame raisins come from red flame grapes. They are sweeter than green "Thompson Seedless" grapes.

"Thompson" raisins are sun dried without any additional processing. This takes up to 3 weeks and raises their cost. "Sultana" raisins are dipped in oil (organic vegetable oil or more typically organic olive oil) and laid out in the sun to dry. This greatly speeds up the drying process and prevents them from becoming dark like "Thompson" raisins. Their processing being more industrial they are less popular but equally delicious.</li> <li>Flame raisins come from red flame grapes. They are sweeter than green "Thompson Seedless" grapes.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Yacon?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yacon is a perennial root vegetable that looks something like a sweet potato. Yacon root grows naturally in South America and is known for being both sweet and filling.</li>
<li>Yacon root contains good carbohydrates known as fructoogliosaccharides (FOS). FOS are insoluble fibers or prebiotics that our bodies can’t digest. That might sound like a bad thing, but it’s actually the reason they’re so good for us. They make us feel full without adding calories.</li>

<p>Dried cherries' sweet flavor makes them welcome in salads. Combine them with chopped roasted walnuts and sliced pear over a bed of dark leafy greens, such as spinach or arugula. They also work well in grain salads -- for example, a mixture of quinoa, fresh mint, dried cherries, sliced oranges and an orange juice vinaigrette. Alternatively, add them to tuna or chicken salad for use in sandwiches, or bake them into whole-grain muffins.</p>
<p>Cherries serve as a good source of copper, an essential mineral. Your body relies on copper to aid collagen production, a process needed to keep your tissues strong. Copper also supports tissue health by protecting you from free radicals, compounds that would otherwise contribute to tissue damage, and by helping your cells produce energy. Each quarter-cup serving of cherries contains 92 micrograms of copper, or 10 percent of your recommended daily intake.</p>

<p>These sweet dehydrated berries are fun to eat. They make a good snack on their own. They are also easy to sprinkle on salads and on sweet or savory dishes. Their bright color makes simple food presentations more appealing. More importantly, dried wild blueberries are a superfood, for good reason. They're packed with nutrients, high in fiber, and low in calories.</p>
<p>Dried blueberries count as one of the more popular fruits and vegetables with the highest antioxidant capacity. They're rich in anthocyanins, the colored water-soluble naturally-occurring antioxidants responsible for the beautiful deep-blue color of blueberries.</p>
<p>Anthocyanins help keep your cardiovascular system healthy. They strengthen the arteries and veins, and promote better blood circulation. They prevent heart disease. Likewise, they keep illnesses like ulcers, glaucoma, and cataract at bay.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic dried "Sultana" raisins are full of natural sugars and are a great choice to curb your sweet cravings without loading on extra calories. Boron, which is essential for bone formation is present in large quantities in raisins. Raisins are also packed with calcium which is required for bone strength.</p>
<p>From raisin bread, as a topping for oatmeal to trail mixes, our dried "sultana" raisins have so many uses. You can also soak them in water overnight to enhance their nutritional profile.</p>
<p>Did you know that is takes 4 times the amount of fresh grapes to make dried grapes?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between Thompson, Sultana, Flame raisins and Zante currants?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both "Thompson" and "Sultana" raisins come from the same "Thompson Seedless" green grape variety.</li>
<li>The difference between "Thompson" and "Sultana" raisins lies in how they are dried. "Thompson" raisins are sun dried without any additional processing. This takes up to 3 weeks and raises their cost. "Sultana" raisins are dipped in oil (organic vegetable oil or more typically organic olive oil) and laid out in the sun to dry. This greatly speeds up the drying process and prevents them from becoming dark like "Thompson" raisins. Their processing being more industrial they are less popular but equally delicious.</li>
<li>Flame raisins come from red flame grapes. They are sweeter than green "Thompson Seedless" grapes. They are sun dried without any additional processing.</li>
<li>Zante currants also known as "corinth raisins" are very small raisins (1/4 of the size of Thompson seedless). They are red when fresh and get a very dark black when dried. Their name comes from the island of Zakynthos (Zante) in Greece which first started commercially exporting them.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic dried pitted prunes are impressively high in nutrients. They contain over 15 different vitamins and minerals, in addition to fiber and antioxidants.</p>
<p>Not a fan of prunes? You’re not alone. In the US, a research found women of ages 25-54 to react negatively to the idea of prunes, so the California Prune Board pressured the Food and Drug Administration to change the name of prunes to the more inviting “dried plums”. And it worked! Prunes are basically plums that have been dried naturally in the sun without undergoing any fermentation process.</p>
<p>Prunes are well known for their ability to relieve constipation. This is partly due to the high amount of fiber in prunes. The fiber in prunes is mostly insoluble, which means it does not blend with water. It plays a role in preventing constipation by adding bulk to your stool and may speed up the rate that waste moves through your digestive tract.</p>
<p>Prunes do not cause diarrhea unless you eat over 1/4–1/2 cup (44–87 grams) per day. That is a lot of dried prunes!</p>
