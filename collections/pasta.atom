    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic "Penne" durum whole wheat pasta is perfect for all your healthy meals. Made with stone milled organic whole wheat durum flour.</p>
<p>Whole wheat durum flour is made from whole grain wheat and thus retains the nutrients found in whole grains. Whole grains have the 3 parts of the grain; The bran, endosperm and germ.</p>
<p>Durum wheat, also called pasta wheat or macaroni wheat is the second most cultivated species of wheat after common wheat. Durum in Latin means "hard", and the species is the hardest of all wheats. This refers to the resistance of the grain to milling, in particular of the starchy endosperm, implying dough made from its flour is weak or "soft". This makes durum favorable for semolina and pasta.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are your different types of pasta?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conchiglie:
<ul>
<li>Region: Naples (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Conchiglie pronounced as "con-keel-yay" and also known as "seashells" or “shells”, is medium sized conch shaped pasta. This shell-shaped pasta holds sauces well and the ideal sauce bases of this pasta include meat sauces and tomato sauces. The name is derived from "conchiglia", an Italian word that means seashell. In fact, this word is similar in meaning with the English "conch", which has been derived from "konkhe", the Greek word for shell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fusilli:
<ul>
<li>Region: Southern Italy</li>
<li>The word fusilli presumably comes from Italian: fuso, meaning "spindle" but is commonly reffered to as "rotini". This classic fusilli is much larger than its fusilli paesani cousin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fusilli Paesani:
<ul>
<li>Region: Southern Italy</li>
<li>Made by wrapping strips of pasta around a thin rod and allowing it to dry out. The result is a spiral shape that resembles a spring or a corkscrew.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Linguine:
<ul>
<li>Region: Genoa &amp; Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>This long, thin, flat noodle resembles a flattened spaghetti. Because it comes from the coast, linguine is often paired with seafood, particularly clams. The name means ''little tongues''</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macaroni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Naples (southern Italy)</li>
<li>One of the oldest forms of pasta, "macaroni" comes from the Greeks, who established the colony of Neopolis (modern day Naples) between 2000 and 1000BC, and appropriated a local dish made from barley-flour pasta and water called "macaria", possibly named after a Greek goddess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Orecchiette:
<ul>
<li>Region: Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Orecchiette means “little ears”. It is shaped like a cup or a small bowl, which catches the sauce. One of the most popular ways to serve orecchiette is with broccoli rabe and sausage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paccheri:
<ul>
<li>Region: Campania (south-west Italy)</li>
<li>Paccheri is a smooth tube of pasta from Campania that likely originated in Naples. Its shape is sometimes compared to pieces of cut up garden hose. One origin legend says that Sicilian pasta-makers created paccheri to smuggle banned garlic cloves into Austria (known as Prussia at the time) in the 1600s where imported garlic had been banned, as the garlic fit neatly in the hollowed out tube of pasta.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Penne Rigate:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>Penne means quill or feather, perhaps due to the slated ends of this ridged, tube-shaped pasta. Though penne originated in Liguria, one of the most beloved recipes for penne, called arrabbiata, comes from Rome. Arrabbiata, meaning “angry,” is a spicy red sauce made with tomatoes, chili peppers, and garlic.</li>
<li>Penne Rigate is slightly shorter than Penne Ziti and is more rigid when cooked than Penne Ziti.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Raschiatelli (Cavatelli):
<ul>
<li>Region: Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>It has an elongated shape with an opening in the middle. It’s made by pressing a finger into the center of each piece of dough. The final result is a pasta that looks like a shell or a hot dog bun. The traditional Cavatelli is served with pork sausage ragu. This is a hearty substantial sauce based on pork ribs, sausages, and tomato pulp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rigatoni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Rome (central Italy)</li>
<li>The name for these short tubes of pasta comes from the word <em>rigato</em>, which means “ridged.” Though rigatoni is generally bigger than penne (and doesn’t have the curved ends) it can be cut in a variety of diameters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spaghettoni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Disputed (Sicily or Abruzzo)</li>
<li>Spaghettoni is a thicker version of the classic spaghetti pasta. Other than that it is pretty much the same.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spaghetti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Disputed (Sicily or Abruzzo)</li>
<li>Spaghetti might be the most popular, and best known, style of pasta, and it's also one of the oldest. One cultural survey of Sicily from around 1154 mentions a precursor to spaghetti, dried strands of dough made from wheat flour, being exported to other regions of Italy. Another version called <em>spaghetti alla chitarra</em> originated in Abruzzo, where it was first made using a tool similar to a guitar (chitarra means guitar). The dough was placed on the chitarra then pushed through so that the strings cut the sheet of dough into strips.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strascinati:
<ul>
<li>Region: Basilicata &amp; Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Strascinati are very similar to orecchiette, just larger. Their name is derived from the verb strascinare, meaning to pull, because they are traditionally made by pulling small chunks of pasta dough over the baking boards (grooved boards are used for the ridged version of this pasta). Strascinati can be paired with simple tomato sauces and classic ragùs, or it can simply be flavored with fried breadcrumbs, anchovies, and peperoni cruschi.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strozzapreti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Emilia Romagna (northern Italy)</li>
<li>The name for these short twists translates as ''priest strangler''. Inspired by the legend that greedy priests would eat the strozzapreti, given to them by locals, so quickly that they might choke on it. Serve with light, smooth sauces that will cling to the twists, pesto would work well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trofie:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>These small, rolled pasta shapes are traditionally served the Genovese way with pesto, green beans and potatoes.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Spaghetti might be the most popular, and best known, style of pasta, and it's also one of the oldest. One cultural survey of Sicily from around 1154 mentions a precursor to spaghetti, dried strands of dough made from wheat flour, being exported to other regions of Italy.

</li>
<li>Strascinati:
<ul>
<li>Region: Basilicata &amp; Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Strascinati are very similar to orecchiette, just larger. Their name is derived from the verb strascinare, meaning to pull, because they are traditionally made by pulling small chunks of pasta dough over the baking boards (grooved boards are used for the ridged version of this pasta). Strascinati can be paired with simple tomato sauces and classic ragùs, or it can simply be flavored with fried breadcrumbs, anchovies, and peperoni cruschi.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strozzapreti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Emilia Romagna (northern Italy)</li>
<li>The name for these short twists translates as ''priest strangler''. Inspired by the legend that greedy priests would eat the strozzapreti, given to them by locals, so quickly that they might choke on it. Serve with light, smooth sauces that will cling to the twists, pesto would work well.</li>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are conchiglie?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The name derives from the Italian word for seashell (conchiglia). The Italian word conchiglie and the English word "conch" share the same Greek root in the form of κοχύλι (kochýli), which means "shell".</li>
<li>Unlike other pasta shapes that have retained their italian named conchiglie are now most times just called shells.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic "Fusilli" tri-color vegetable pasta gives a dash of color to compliment your dishes. Made with stone milled organic whole wheat durum flour, organic spinach powder (green) and organic red beet powder (red).</p>
<p>Whole wheat durum flour is made from whole grain wheat and thus retains the nutrients found in whole grains. Whole grains have the 3 parts of the grain; The bran, endosperm and germ.</p>
<p>Durum wheat, also called pasta wheat or macaroni wheat is the second most cultivated species of wheat after common wheat. Durum in Latin means "hard", and the species is the hardest of all wheats. This refers to the resistance of the grain to milling, in particular of the starchy endosperm, implying dough made from its flour is weak or "soft". This makes durum favorable for semolina and pasta.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are your different types of pasta?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conchiglie:
<ul>
<li>Region: Naples (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Conchiglie pronounced as "con-keel-yay" and also known as "seashells" or “shells”, is medium sized conch shaped pasta. This shell-shaped pasta holds sauces well and the ideal sauce bases of this pasta include meat sauces and tomato sauces. The name is derived from "conchiglia", an Italian word that means seashell. In fact, this word is similar in meaning with the English "conch", which has been derived from "konkhe", the Greek word for shell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fusilli:
<ul>
<li>Region: Southern Italy</li>
<li>The word fusilli presumably comes from Italian: fuso, meaning "spindle" but is commonly reffered to as "rotini". This classic fusilli is much larger than its fusilli paesani cousin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fusilli Paesani:
<ul>
<li>Region: Southern Italy</li>
<li>Made by wrapping strips of pasta around a thin rod and allowing it to dry out. The result is a spiral shape that resembles a spring or a corkscrew.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Linguine:
<ul>
<li>Region: Genoa &amp; Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>This long, thin, flat noodle resembles a flattened spaghetti. Because it comes from the coast, linguine is often paired with seafood, particularly clams. The name means ''little tongues''</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macaroni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Naples (southern Italy)</li>
<li>One of the oldest forms of pasta, "macaroni" comes from the Greeks, who established the colony of Neopolis (modern day Naples) between 2000 and 1000BC, and appropriated a local dish made from barley-flour pasta and water called "macaria", possibly named after a Greek goddess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Orecchiette:
<ul>
<li>Region: Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Orecchiette means “little ears”. It is shaped like a cup or a small bowl, which catches the sauce. One of the most popular ways to serve orecchiette is with broccoli rabe and sausage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paccheri:
<ul>
<li>Region: Campania (south-west Italy)</li>
<li>Paccheri is a smooth tube of pasta from Campania that likely originated in Naples. Its shape is sometimes compared to pieces of cut up garden hose. One origin legend says that Sicilian pasta-makers created paccheri to smuggle banned garlic cloves into Austria (known as Prussia at the time) in the 1600s where imported garlic had been banned, as the garlic fit neatly in the hollowed out tube of pasta.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Penne Rigate:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>Penne means quill or feather, perhaps due to the slated ends of this ridged, tube-shaped pasta. Though penne originated in Liguria, one of the most beloved recipes for penne, called arrabbiata, comes from Rome. Arrabbiata, meaning “angry,” is a spicy red sauce made with tomatoes, chili peppers, and garlic.</li>
<li>Penne Rigate is slightly shorter than Penne Ziti and is more rigid when cooked than Penne Ziti.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic "Fusilli" spelt pasta is a perfect alternative to traditional wheat pasta. Spelt also known as "dinkel wheat" or "hulled wheat", is a species of wheat that has been cultivated since approximately 5000 BC.</p>
<p>Spelt was introduced to north America in the 1890s. In the 20th century, spelt was replaced by bread wheat in almost all areas where it was still grown. The organic farming movement revived its popularity somewhat toward the end of the century, as spelt requires less fertilizer. Since the beginning of the 21st century, spelt has become a common wheat substitute for making artisanal loaves of bread, kinds of pasta, and flakes.</p>

<li>Macaroni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Naples (southern Italy)</li>
<li>One of the oldest forms of pasta, "macaroni" comes from the Greeks, who established the colony of Neopolis (modern day Naples) between 2000 and 1000BC, and appropriated a local dish made from barley-flour pasta and water called "macaria", possibly named after a Greek goddess.</li>

<li>Orecchiette:
<ul>
<li>Region: Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Orecchiette means “little ears”. It is shaped like a cup or a small bowl, which catches the sauce. One of the most popular ways to serve orecchiette is with broccoli rabe and sausage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paccheri:
<ul>
<li>Region: Campania (south-west Italy)</li>
<li>Paccheri is a smooth tube of pasta from Campania that likely originated in Naples. Its shape is sometimes compared to pieces of cut up garden hose. One origin legend says that Sicilian pasta-makers created paccheri to smuggle banned garlic cloves into Austria (known as Prussia at the time) in the 1600s where imported garlic had been banned, as the garlic fit neatly in the hollowed out tube of pasta.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Penne Rigate:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>Penne means quill or feather, perhaps due to the slated ends of this ridged, tube-shaped pasta.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Raschiatelli (Cavatelli):
<ul>
<li>Region: Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>It has an elongated shape with an opening in the middle. It’s made by pressing a finger into the center of each piece of dough. The final result is a pasta that looks like a shell or a hot dog bun. The traditional Cavatelli is served with pork sausage ragu. This is a hearty substantial sauce based on pork ribs, sausages, and tomato pulp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rigatoni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Rome (central Italy)</li>
<li>The name for these short tubes of pasta comes from the word <em>rigato</em>, which means “ridged.” Though rigatoni is generally bigger than penne (and doesn’t have the curved ends) it can be cut in a variety of diameters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spaghettoni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Disputed (Sicily or Abruzzo)</li>
<li>Spaghettoni is a thicker version of the classic spaghetti pasta. Other than that it is pretty much the same.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spaghetti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Disputed (Sicily or Abruzzo)</li>
<li>Spaghetti might be the most popular, and best known, style of pasta, and it's also one of the oldest. One cultural survey of Sicily from around 1154 mentions a precursor to spaghetti, dried strands of dough made from wheat flour, being exported to other regions of Italy. Another version called <em>spaghetti alla chitarra</em> originated in Abruzzo, where it was first made using a tool similar to a guitar (chitarra means guitar). The dough was placed on the chitarra then pushed through so that the strings cut the sheet of dough into strips.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strascinati:
<ul>
<li>Region: Basilicata &amp; Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Strascinati are very similar to orecchiette, just larger. Their name is derived from the verb strascinare, meaning to pull, because they are traditionally made by pulling small chunks of pasta dough over the baking boards (grooved boards are used for the ridged version of this pasta). Strascinati can be paired with simple tomato sauces and classic ragùs, or it can simply be flavored with fried breadcrumbs, anchovies, and peperoni cruschi.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strozzapreti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Emilia Romagna (northern Italy)</li>
<li>The name for these short twists translates as ''priest strangler''. Inspired by the legend that greedy priests would eat the strozzapreti, given to them by locals, so quickly that they might choke on it. Serve with light, smooth sauces that will cling to the twists, pesto would work well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trofie:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>These small, rolled pasta shapes are traditionally served the Genovese way with pesto, green beans and potatoes.</li>

<p>White corn flour enriched with turmeric and pepper has an ochre colour that becomes orange after being cooked: you are going to love it! Gifted by a charming colour, these ingredients also have great nutritional properties. As a matter of fact, turmeric has purifying, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Black pepper was added to the recipe because it eases the assimilation of turmeric and does not change the taste of pasta. Thanks to its pleasant flavour, white corn, turmeric and pepper pasta can be tasted with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, in order to flavour it at its best. You can also create brand new recipes using seasonal ingredients.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic ''Tagliardi'' egg pasta is made with durum wheat &amp; fresh eggs. Don't fall for the inferior egg powder pasta. This very thin and delicate pasta is made by Cipriani in Italy for the most authentic taste. Durum wheat is the best wheat for pasta making.</p>
<p>This egg pasta is very filling. One 250 gram box makes 5 portions as egg pasta absorbs a lot more water than regular pasta. For all your traditional Italian pasta recipes you can trust Cipriani pasta.</p>
<p><em>Notice: Our Cipriani pasta is sold as organic as it is made with organic ingredients. However it holds no official organic certification.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who is ''Cipriani''?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cipriani was founded in Venice, Italy in 1931. Giussipe Cipriani opened the doors to Harry’s Bar along a canal just off Piazza San Marco, Venice, Italy. He then expanded his Cipriani empire to hotels &amp; gourmet delicacies from Venice. His Cipriani pasta is an extra thin egg pasta which is made out of only 3 ingredients, Durum Wheat, Semolina &amp; Eggs.</li>
<li>Cipriani uses the best ingredients; 7 fresh eggs for each kg of durum wheat semolina. With their designed machine, they slowly process it through rollers and presses as many as 60 times. After a 14 hour drying period at low temperature, here it is: a thin sheet of pasta dough with a silky mounthfeel, that generously grows perfectly ''al dente'' in a few minutes of cooking.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are your different types of Cipriani pasta?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pappardelle:
<ul>
<li>Region: Tuscany (Central Italy)</li>
<li>Pappardelle are wide ribbons of egg pasta, normally reserved for heavy, gamey ragus, and made things like wild mushrooms, wild rabbit or wild boar. Lovely chunky bits from the sauce get trapped between the flat noodles and it almost eats like a lasagne.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taglairelle (Tagliatelle):
<ul>
<li>Region: Emilia-Romagna (Northern Italy)</li>
<li>Tagliarelle are long, golden, silk-laden ribbons of pasta, a little wider than fettuccine. Their name comes from the Italian word "tagliare", or "to cut". It comes from the Emilia-Romagna region, while fettuccine is Roman. It can also be used in place of linguine. Tagliatelle is to fresh egg pasta what spaghetti is to dried. It’s the big favourite in Northern Italy. It’s also often served with the cheesy, buttery sauces Italians that from the north love so much, and especially with fresh basil pesto in Liguria. Tagliatelle has a soft and unchallenging texture and, when served simply with fresh asparagus, tomato, and basil.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tagliardi (Maltagliati):
<ul>
<li>Region Vento (North-eastern Italy)</li>
<li>These are the Cipriani interpretation of the maltagliati. They come in squares of about 3 centimeters by 3. The particular format makes them very versatile, they are perfect dipped in a traditional pasta and beans recipe. Another great classic is the Tagliardi with pesto.</li>
<li>In Italian, the word "maltagliati" literally means "badly cut"! Traditionally, these squares, rhombus or irregularly shaped flat pasta pieces started life as the remains of rolled out tagliatelle pasta dough or re-kneaded ravioli cuttings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tagliolini:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (North-western Italy)</li>
<li>Tagliolini is a thin pasta that about 3 mm wide. Tagliolini is very similar to tagliatelle, which is also made in long strands, except that the strands of Tagliolini are sometimes cylindrical, rather than flat, as tagliatelle’s are. The sauces used with Tagliolini are usually smooth, creamy and relatively thin.</li>
<li>In Rome, the pasta has become popular served as a dish called "tagliolini cacio e pepe". "Cacio" is pecorino cheese, specifically "pecorino romano"; "pepe" is "pepper", specifically, black pepper. To make it, the romano cheese is finely grated, then mixed in a bowl with the pepper and a ladleful of the cooking water from the pasta to make a sauce. This sauce is then stirred into the drained, cooked Tagliolini, which is then garnished with some more grated pecorino, then served.</li>

<p><strong>Who is ''Cipriani''?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cipriani was founded in Venice, Italy in 1931. Giussipe Cipriani opened the doors to Harry’s Bar along a canal just off Piazza San Marco, Venice, Italy. He then expanded his Cipriani empire to hotels &amp; gourmet delicacies from Venice. His Cipriani pasta is an extra thin egg pasta which is made out of only 3 ingredients, Durum Wheat, Semolina &amp; Eggs.</li>
<li>Cipriani uses the best ingredients; 7 fresh eggs for each kg of durum wheat semolina. With their designed machine, they slowly process it through rollers and presses as many as 60 times. After a 14 hour drying period at low temperature, here it is: a thin sheet of pasta dough with a silky mounthfeel, that generously grows perfectly ''al dente'' in a few minutes of cooking.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are your different types of Cipriani pasta?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pappardelle:
<ul>
<li>Region: Tuscany (Central Italy)</li>
<li>Pappardelle are wide ribbons of egg pasta, normally reserved for heavy, gamey ragus, and made things like wild mushrooms, wild rabbit or wild boar. Lovely chunky bits from the sauce get trapped between the flat noodles and it almost eats like a lasagne.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taglairelle (Tagliatelle):
<ul>
<li>Region: Emilia-Romagna (Northern Italy)</li>
<li>Tagliarelle are long, golden, silk-laden ribbons of pasta, a little wider than fettuccine. Their name comes from the Italian word "tagliare", or "to cut". It comes from the Emilia-Romagna region, while fettuccine is Roman. It can also be used in place of linguine. Tagliatelle is to fresh egg pasta what spaghetti is to dried. It’s the big favourite in Northern Italy. It’s also often served with the cheesy, buttery sauces Italians that from the north love so much, and especially with fresh basil pesto in Liguria. Tagliatelle has a soft and unchallenging texture and, when served simply with fresh asparagus, tomato, and basil.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tagliardi (Maltagliati):
<ul>
<li>Region Vento (North-eastern Italy)</li>
<li>These are the Cipriani interpretation of the maltagliati. They come in squares of about 3 centimeters by 3. The particular format makes them very versatile, they are perfect dipped in a traditional pasta and beans recipe. Another great classic is the Tagliardi with pesto.</li>
<li>In Italian, the word "maltagliati" literally means "badly cut"! Traditionally, these squares, rhombus or irregularly shaped flat pasta pieces started life as the remains of rolled out tagliatelle pasta dough or re-kneaded ravioli cuttings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tagliolini:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (North-western Italy)</li>
<li>Tagliolini is a thin pasta that about 3 mm wide. Tagliolini is very similar to tagliatelle, which is also made in long strands, except that the strands of Tagliolini are sometimes cylindrical, rather than flat, as tagliatelle’s are. The sauces used with Tagliolini are usually smooth, creamy and relatively thin.</li>
<li>In Rome, the pasta has become popular served as a dish called "tagliolini cacio e pepe". "Cacio" is pecorino cheese, specifically "pecorino romano"; "pepe" is "pepper", specifically, black pepper. To make it, the romano cheese is finely grated, then mixed in a bowl with the pepper and a ladleful of the cooking water from the pasta to make a sauce. This sauce is then stirred into the drained, cooked Tagliolini, which is then garnished with some more grated pecorino, then served.</li>
</ul>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic ''Spaghettoni'' durum wheat pasta is made in Italy for the most authentic taste. Durum wheat is the best wheat for pasta making.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who is ''Pasta di Stigliano''?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pasta di Stigliano boasts an ancient tradition of industrious pasta makers who became famous even overseas with the name of "maccheronieri", who already from 1824 in Stigliano mixed with art and skill simple natural ingredients to create a fine pasta. The taste and quality of Pasta di Stigliano derives, today as then, from the careful selection of grains typical of our area, not genetically modified, including the famous "Senatore Capelli" and the "Saragolle Lucane" mixed with other hard grains Lucani. The slow drying at "low temperatures" and the "bronze drawing" guarantee a high quality pasta, tasty, genuine and above all digestible.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why is this pasta so white and not yellow like most pasta?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once pasta is formed it needs to be dried. 99% of all pasta is hot air dried at what is considered ''high temperatures'' 80-120deg C for a couple of hours. This caramelizes the starch in the wheat leading to the yellow color.</li>
<li>Caramelized foods just like BBQ or grilling is not considered very healthy and creates cancerigenic byproducts. The same goes for pasta.</li>
<li>''Pasta di Stigliano'' like other premium Italian pastas which are very rare in Canada are dried at ''low temperatures'' 40-45deg C for a couple of days. Yes, days!</li>
<li>This is why this premium pasta is more white. Other than the cancerigenic reason, low temperature drying gives a better texture, less rubbery and they also absorb flavors better.</li>
<li>To conclude, if you are looking for a healthy authentic Italian pasta, this is it.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are your different types of pasta?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conchiglie:
<ul>
<li>Region: Naples (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Conchiglie pronounced as "con-keel-yay" and also known as "seashells" or “shells”, is medium sized conch shaped pasta. This shell-shaped pasta holds sauces well and the ideal sauce bases of this pasta include meat sauces and tomato sauces. The name is derived from "conchiglia", an Italian word that means seashell. In fact, this word is similar in meaning with the English "conch", which has been derived from "konkhe", the Greek word for shell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fusilli:
<ul>
<li>Region: Southern Italy</li>
<li>The word fusilli presumably comes from Italian: fuso, meaning "spindle" but is commonly reffered to as "rotini". This classic fusilli is much larger than its fusilli paesani cousin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fusilli Paesani:
<ul>
<li>Region: Southern Italy</li>
<li>Made by wrapping strips of pasta around a thin rod and allowing it to dry out. The result is a spiral shape that resembles a spring or a corkscrew.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Linguine:
<ul>
<li>Region: Genoa &amp; Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>This long, thin, flat noodle resembles a flattened spaghetti. Because it comes from the coast, linguine is often paired with seafood, particularly clams. The name means ''little tongues''</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macaroni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Naples (southern Italy)</li>
<li>One of the oldest forms of pasta, "macaroni" comes from the Greeks, who established the colony of Neopolis (modern day Naples) between 2000 and 1000BC, and appropriated a local dish made from barley-flour pasta and water called "macaria", possibly named after a Greek goddess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Orecchiette:
<ul>
<li>Region: Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Orecchiette means “little ears”. It is shaped like a cup or a small bowl, which catches the sauce. One of the most popular ways to serve orecchiette is with broccoli rabe and sausage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paccheri:
<ul>
<li>Region: Campania (south-west Italy)</li>
<li>Paccheri is a smooth tube of pasta from Campania that likely originated in Naples. Its shape is sometimes compared to pieces of cut up garden hose. One origin legend says that Sicilian pasta-makers created paccheri to smuggle banned garlic cloves into Austria (known as Prussia at the time) in the 1600s where imported garlic had been banned, as the garlic fit neatly in the hollowed out tube of pasta.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Penne Rigate:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>Penne means quill or feather, perhaps due to the slated ends of this ridged, tube-shaped pasta. Though penne originated in Liguria, one of the most beloved recipes for penne, called arrabbiata, comes from Rome. Arrabbiata, meaning “angry,” is a spicy red sauce made with tomatoes, chili peppers, and garlic.</li>
<li>Penne Rigate is slightly shorter than Penne Ziti and is more rigid when cooked than Penne Ziti.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Penne Ziti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>Penne means quill or feather, perhaps due to the slated ends of this ridged, tube-shaped pasta. Though penne originated in Liguria, one of the most beloved recipes for penne, called arrabbiata, comes from Rome. Arrabbiata, meaning “angry,” is a spicy red sauce made with tomatoes, chili peppers, and garlic.</li>
<li>Penne Ziti is slightly longer than Penne Rigate is consistently smooth in texture. When cooked, it tends to turn soft and buttery, whereas penne retains more of its rigidity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raschiatelli (Cavatelli):
<ul>
<li>Region: Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>It has an elongated shape with an opening in the middle. It’s made by pressing a finger into the center of each piece of dough. The final result is a pasta that looks like a shell or a hot dog bun. The traditional Cavatelli is served with pork sausage ragu. This is a hearty substantial sauce based on pork ribs, sausages, and tomato pulp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rigatoni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Rome (central Italy)</li>
<li>The name for these short tubes of pasta comes from the word <em>rigato</em>, which means “ridged.” Though rigatoni is generally bigger than penne (and doesn’t have the curved ends) it can be cut in a variety of diameters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spaghettoni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Disputed (Sicily or Abruzzo)</li>
<li>Spaghettoni is a thicker version of the classic spaghetti pasta. Other than that it is pretty much the same.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spaghetti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Disputed (Sicily or Abruzzo)</li>
<li>Spaghetti might be the most popular, and best known, style of pasta, and it's also one of the oldest. One cultural survey of Sicily from around 1154 mentions a precursor to spaghetti, dried strands of dough made from wheat flour, being exported to other regions of Italy. Another version called <em>spaghetti alla chitarra</em> originated in Abruzzo, where it was first made using a tool similar to a guitar (chitarra means guitar). The dough was placed on the chitarra then pushed through so that the strings cut the sheet of dough into strips.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strascinati:
<ul>
<li>Region: Basilicata &amp; Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Strascinati are very similar to orecchiette, just larger. Their name is derived from the verb strascinare, meaning to pull, because they are traditionally made by pulling small chunks of pasta dough over the baking boards (grooved boards are used for the ridged version of this pasta). Strascinati can be paired with simple tomato sauces and classic ragùs, or it can simply be flavored with fried breadcrumbs, anchovies, and peperoni cruschi.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strozzapreti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Emilia Romagna (northern Italy)</li>
<li>The name for these short twists translates as ''priest strangler''. Inspired by the legend that greedy priests would eat the strozzapreti, given to them by locals, so quickly that they might choke on it. Serve with light, smooth sauces that will cling to the twists, pesto would work well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trofie:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>These small, rolled pasta shapes are traditionally served the Genovese way with pesto, green beans and potatoes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Storage Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.</li>
<li>Store below 15°C and &lt; 65% humidity.</li>
<li>Store in the dark as light degrades flavors.</li>
<li>Mason jars make great storage containers.</li>
<li>Can be frozen to prolong shelf life.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic ''Paccheri'' durum wheat pasta is made in Italy for the most authentic taste. Durum wheat is the best wheat for pasta making.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who is ''Pasta di Stigliano''?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pasta di Stigliano boasts an ancient tradition of industrious pasta makers who became famous even overseas with the name of "maccheronieri", who already from 1824 in Stigliano mixed with art and skill simple natural ingredients to create a fine pasta. The taste and quality of Pasta di Stigliano derives, today as then, from the careful selection of grains typical of our area, not genetically modified, including the famous "Senatore Capelli" and the "Saragolle Lucane" mixed with other hard grains Lucani. The slow drying at "low temperatures" and the "bronze drawing" guarantee a high quality pasta, tasty, genuine and above all digestible.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why is this pasta so white and not yellow like most pasta?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once pasta is formed it needs to be dried. 99% of all pasta is hot air dried at what is considered ''high temperatures'' 80-120deg C for a couple of hours. This caramelizes the starch in the wheat leading to the yellow color.</li>
<li>Caramelized foods just like BBQ or grilling is not considered very healthy and creates cancerigenic byproducts. The same goes for pasta.</li>
<li>''Pasta di Stigliano'' like other premium Italian pastas which are very rare in Canada are dried at ''low temperatures'' 40-45deg C for a couple of days. Yes, days!</li>
<li>This is why this premium pasta is more white. Other than the cancerigenic reason, low temperature drying gives a better texture, less rubbery and they also absorb flavors better.</li>
<li>To conclude, if you are looking for a healthy authentic Italian pasta, this is it.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are your different types of pasta?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conchiglie:
<ul>
<li>Region: Naples (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Conchiglie pronounced as "con-keel-yay" and also known as "seashells" or “shells”, is medium sized conch shaped pasta. This shell-shaped pasta holds sauces well and the ideal sauce bases of this pasta include meat sauces and tomato sauces. The name is derived from "conchiglia", an Italian word that means seashell. In fact, this word is similar in meaning with the English "conch", which has been derived from "konkhe", the Greek word for shell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fusilli:
<ul>
<li>Region: Southern Italy</li>
<li>The word fusilli presumably comes from Italian: fuso, meaning "spindle" but is commonly reffered to as "rotini". This classic fusilli is much larger than its fusilli paesani cousin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fusilli Paesani:
<ul>
<li>Region: Southern Italy</li>
<li>Made by wrapping strips of pasta around a thin rod and allowing it to dry out. The result is a spiral shape that resembles a spring or a corkscrew.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Linguine:
<ul>
<li>Region: Genoa &amp; Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>This long, thin, flat noodle resembles a flattened spaghetti. Because it comes from the coast, linguine is often paired with seafood, particularly clams. The name means ''little tongues''</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macaroni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Naples (southern Italy)</li>
<li>One of the oldest forms of pasta, "macaroni" comes from the Greeks, who established the colony of Neopolis (modern day Naples) between 2000 and 1000BC, and appropriated a local dish made from barley-flour pasta and water called "macaria", possibly named after a Greek goddess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Orecchiette:
<ul>
<li>Region: Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Orecchiette means “little ears”. It is shaped like a cup or a small bowl, which catches the sauce. One of the most popular ways to serve orecchiette is with broccoli rabe and sausage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paccheri:
<ul>
<li>Region: Campania (south-west Italy)</li>
<li>Paccheri is a smooth tube of pasta from Campania that likely originated in Naples. Its shape is sometimes compared to pieces of cut up garden hose. One origin legend says that Sicilian pasta-makers created paccheri to smuggle banned garlic cloves into Austria (known as Prussia at the time) in the 1600s where imported garlic had been banned, as the garlic fit neatly in the hollowed out tube of pasta.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Penne Rigate:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>Penne means quill or feather, perhaps due to the slated ends of this ridged, tube-shaped pasta. Though penne originated in Liguria, one of the most beloved recipes for penne, called arrabbiata, comes from Rome. Arrabbiata, meaning “angry,” is a spicy red sauce made with tomatoes, chili peppers, and garlic.</li>
<li>Penne Rigate is slightly shorter than Penne Ziti and is more rigid when cooked than Penne Ziti.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Penne Ziti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>Penne means quill or feather, perhaps due to the slated ends of this ridged, tube-shaped pasta. Though penne originated in Liguria, one of the most beloved recipes for penne, called arrabbiata, comes from Rome. Arrabbiata, meaning “angry,” is a spicy red sauce made with tomatoes, chili peppers, and garlic.</li>
<li>Penne Ziti is slightly longer than Penne Rigate is consistently smooth in texture. When cooked, it tends to turn soft and buttery, whereas penne retains more of its rigidity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raschiatelli (Cavatelli):
<ul>
<li>Region: Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>It has an elongated shape with an opening in the middle. It’s made by pressing a finger into the center of each piece of dough. The final result is a pasta that looks like a shell or a hot dog bun. The traditional Cavatelli is served with pork sausage ragu. This is a hearty substantial sauce based on pork ribs, sausages, and tomato pulp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rigatoni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Rome (central Italy)</li>
<li>The name for these short tubes of pasta comes from the word <em>rigato</em>, which means “ridged.” Though rigatoni is generally bigger than penne (and doesn’t have the curved ends) it can be cut in a variety of diameters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spaghettoni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Disputed (Sicily or Abruzzo)</li>
<li>Spaghettoni is a thicker version of the classic spaghetti pasta. Other than that it is pretty much the same.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spaghetti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Disputed (Sicily or Abruzzo)</li>
<li>Spaghetti might be the most popular, and best known, style of pasta, and it's also one of the oldest. One cultural survey of Sicily from around 1154 mentions a precursor to spaghetti, dried strands of dough made from wheat flour, being exported to other regions of Italy. Another version called <em>spaghetti alla chitarra</em> originated in Abruzzo, where it was first made using a tool similar to a guitar (chitarra means guitar). The dough was placed on the chitarra then pushed through so that the strings cut the sheet of dough into strips.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strascinati:
<ul>
<li>Region: Basilicata &amp; Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Strascinati are very similar to orecchiette, just larger. Their name is derived from the verb strascinare, meaning to pull, because they are traditionally made by pulling small chunks of pasta dough over the baking boards (grooved boards are used for the ridged version of this pasta). Strascinati can be paired with simple tomato sauces and classic ragùs, or it can simply be flavored with fried breadcrumbs, anchovies, and peperoni cruschi.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strozzapreti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Emilia Romagna (northern Italy)</li>
<li>The name for these short twists translates as ''priest strangler''. Inspired by the legend that greedy priests would eat the strozzapreti, given to them by locals, so quickly that they might choke on it. Serve with light, smooth sauces that will cling to the twists, pesto would work well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trofie:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>These small, rolled pasta shapes are traditionally served the Genovese way with pesto, green beans and potatoes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Storage Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.</li>
<li>Store below 15°C and &lt; 65% humidity.</li>
<li>Store in the dark as light degrades flavors.</li>
<li>Mason jars make great storage containers.</li>
<li>Can be frozen to prolong shelf life.</li>

<li>Paccheri:
<ul>
<li>Region: Campania (south-west Italy)</li>

<li>Raschiatelli (Cavatelli):
<ul>
<li>Region: Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>It has an elongated shape with an opening in the middle. It’s made by pressing a finger into the center of each piece of dough. The final result is a pasta that looks like a shell or a hot dog bun. The traditional Cavatelli is served with pork sausage ragu. This is a hearty substantial sauce based on pork ribs, sausages, and tomato pulp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rigatoni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Rome (central Italy)</li>
<li>The name for these short tubes of pasta comes from the word <em>rigato</em>, which means “ridged.” Though rigatoni is generally bigger than penne (and doesn’t have the curved ends) it can be cut in a variety of diameters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spaghettoni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Disputed (Sicily or Abruzzo)</li>

</li>
<li>Spaghetti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Disputed (Sicily or Abruzzo)</li>
<li>Spaghetti might be the most popular, and best known, style of pasta, and it's also one of the oldest. One cultural survey of Sicily from around 1154 mentions a precursor to spaghetti, dried strands of dough made from wheat flour, being exported to other regions of Italy. Another version called <em>spaghetti alla chitarra</em> originated in Abruzzo, where it was first made using a tool similar to a guitar (chitarra means guitar). The dough was placed on the chitarra then pushed through so that the strings cut the sheet of dough into strips.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strascinati:
<ul>
<li>Region: Basilicata &amp; Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Strascinati are very similar to orecchiette, just larger. Their name is derived from the verb strascinare, meaning to pull, because they are traditionally made by pulling small chunks of pasta dough over the baking boards (grooved boards are used for the ridged version of this pasta). Strascinati can be paired with simple tomato sauces and classic ragùs, or it can simply be flavored with fried breadcrumbs, anchovies, and peperoni cruschi.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strozzapreti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Emilia Romagna (northern Italy)</li>
<li>The name for these short twists translates as ''priest strangler''. Inspired by the legend that greedy priests would eat the strozzapreti, given to them by locals, so quickly that they might choke on it. Serve with light, smooth sauces that will cling to the twists, pesto would work well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trofie:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>These small, rolled pasta shapes are traditionally served the Genovese way with pesto, green beans and potatoes.</li>

<ul>
<li>Nothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.</li>
<li>Store below 15°C and &lt; 65% humidity.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic ''Strascinati''' durum wheat pasta is made in Italy for the most authentic taste. Durum wheat is the best wheat for pasta making.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who is ''Pasta di Stigliano''?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pasta di Stigliano boasts an ancient tradition of industrious pasta makers who became famous even overseas with the name of "maccheronieri", who already from 1824 in Stigliano mixed with art and skill simple natural ingredients to create a fine pasta. The taste and quality of Pasta di Stigliano derives, today as then, from the careful selection of grains typical of our area, not genetically modified, including the famous "Senatore Capelli" and the "Saragolle Lucane" mixed with other hard grains Lucani. The slow drying at "low temperatures" and the "bronze drawing" guarantee a high quality pasta, tasty, genuine and above all digestible.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why is this pasta so white and not yellow like most pasta?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once pasta is formed it needs to be dried. 99% of all pasta is hot air dried at what is considered ''high temperatures'' 80-120deg C for a couple of hours. This caramelizes the starch in the wheat leading to the yellow color.</li>
<li>Caramelized foods just like BBQ or grilling is not considered very healthy and creates cancerigenic byproducts. The same goes for pasta.</li>
<li>''Pasta di Stigliano'' like other premium Italian pastas which are very rare in Canada are dried at ''low temperatures'' 40-45deg C for a couple of days. Yes, days!</li>
<li>This is why this premium pasta is more white. Other than the cancerigenic reason, low temperature drying gives a better texture, less rubbery and they also absorb flavors better.</li>
<li>To conclude, if you are looking for a healthy authentic Italian pasta, this is it.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are your different types of pasta?</strong></p>

<li>Region: Naples (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Conchiglie pronounced as "con-keel-yay" and also known as "seashells" or “shells”, is medium sized conch shaped pasta.

In fact, this word is similar in meaning with the English "conch", which has been derived from "konkhe", the Greek word for shell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fusilli:

</ul>
</li>
<li>Fusilli Paesani:

<li>Linguine:
<ul>
<li>Region: Genoa &amp; Liguria (northern Italy)</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic ''Rigatoni'' durum wheat pasta is made in Italy for the most authentic taste. Durum wheat is the best wheat for pasta making.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who is ''Pasta di Stigliano''?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pasta di Stigliano boasts an ancient tradition of industrious pasta makers who became famous even overseas with the name of "maccheronieri", who already from 1824 in Stigliano mixed with art and skill simple natural ingredients to create a fine pasta. The taste and quality of Pasta di Stigliano derives, today as then, from the careful selection of grains typical of our area, not genetically modified, including the famous "Senatore Capelli" and the "Saragolle Lucane" mixed with other hard grains Lucani. The slow drying at "low temperatures" and the "bronze drawing" guarantee a high quality pasta, tasty, genuine and above all digestible.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why is this pasta so white and not yellow like most pasta?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once pasta is formed it needs to be dried. 99% of all pasta is hot air dried at what is considered ''high temperatures'' 80-120deg C for a couple of hours. This caramelizes the starch in the wheat leading to the yellow color.</li>
<li>Caramelized foods just like BBQ or grilling is not considered very healthy and creates cancerigenic byproducts. The same goes for pasta.</li>
<li>''Pasta di Stigliano'' like other premium Italian pastas which are very rare in Canada are dried at ''low temperatures'' 40-45deg C for a couple of days. Yes, days!</li>
<li>This is why this premium pasta is more white. Other than the cancerigenic reason, low temperature drying gives a better texture, less rubbery and they also absorb flavors better.</li>
<li>To conclude, if you are looking for a healthy authentic Italian pasta, this is it.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are your different types of pasta?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conchiglie:
<ul>
<li>Region: Naples (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Conchiglie pronounced as "con-keel-yay" and also known as "seashells" or “shells”, is medium sized conch shaped pasta. This shell-shaped pasta holds sauces well and the ideal sauce bases of this pasta include meat sauces and tomato sauces. The name is derived from "conchiglia", an Italian word that means seashell. In fact, this word is similar in meaning with the English "conch", which has been derived from "konkhe", the Greek word for shell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fusilli:
<ul>
<li>Region: Southern Italy</li>
<li>The word fusilli presumably comes from Italian: fuso, meaning "spindle" but is commonly reffered to as "rotini". This classic fusilli is much larger than its fusilli paesani cousin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fusilli Paesani:
<ul>
<li>Region: Southern Italy</li>
<li>Made by wrapping strips of pasta around a thin rod and allowing it to dry out. The result is a spiral shape that resembles a spring or a corkscrew.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Linguine:
<ul>
<li>Region: Genoa &amp; Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>This long, thin, flat noodle resembles a flattened spaghetti. Because it comes from the coast, linguine is often paired with seafood, particularly clams. The name means ''little tongues''</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macaroni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Naples (southern Italy)</li>
<li>One of the oldest forms of pasta, "macaroni" comes from the Greeks, who established the colony of Neopolis (modern day Naples) between 2000 and 1000BC, and appropriated a local dish made from barley-flour pasta and water called "macaria", possibly named after a Greek goddess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Orecchiette:
<ul>
<li>Region: Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Orecchiette means “little ears”. It is shaped like a cup or a small bowl, which catches the sauce. One of the most popular ways to serve orecchiette is with broccoli rabe and sausage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paccheri:
<ul>
<li>Region: Campania (south-west Italy)</li>
<li>Paccheri is a smooth tube of pasta from Campania that likely originated in Naples. Its shape is sometimes compared to pieces of cut up garden hose. One origin legend says that Sicilian pasta-makers created paccheri to smuggle banned garlic cloves into Austria (known as Prussia at the time) in the 1600s where imported garlic had been banned, as the garlic fit neatly in the hollowed out tube of pasta.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Penne Rigate:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>Penne means quill or feather, perhaps due to the slated ends of this ridged, tube-shaped pasta. Though penne originated in Liguria, one of the most beloved recipes for penne, called arrabbiata, comes from Rome. Arrabbiata, meaning “angry,” is a spicy red sauce made with tomatoes, chili peppers, and garlic.</li>
<li>Penne Rigate is slightly shorter than Penne Ziti and is more rigid when cooked than Penne Ziti.</li>
</ul>

<li>Penne Ziti:

<li>Penne means quill or feather, perhaps due to the slated ends of this ridged, tube-shaped pasta. Though penne originated in Liguria, one of the most beloved recipes for penne, called arrabbiata, comes from Rome. Arrabbiata, meaning “angry,” is a spicy red sauce made with tomatoes, chili peppers, and garlic.</li>
<li>Penne Ziti is slightly longer than Penne Rigate is consistently smooth in texture. When cooked, it tends to turn soft and buttery, whereas penne retains more of its rigidity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raschiatelli (Cavatelli):
<ul>
<li>Region: Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>It has an elongated shape with an opening in the middle. It’s made by pressing a finger into the center of each piece of dough. The final result is a pasta that looks like a shell or a hot dog bun. The traditional Cavatelli is served with pork sausage ragu. This is a hearty substantial sauce based on pork ribs, sausages, and tomato pulp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rigatoni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Rome (central Italy)</li>
<li>The name for these short tubes of pasta comes from the word <em>rigato</em>, which means “ridged.” Though rigatoni is generally bigger than penne (and doesn’t have the curved ends) it can be cut in a variety of diameters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spaghettoni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Disputed (Sicily or Abruzzo)</li>
<li>Spaghettoni is a thicker version of the classic spaghetti pasta. Other than that it is pretty much the same.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spaghetti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Disputed (Sicily or Abruzzo)</li>
<li>Spaghetti might be the most popular, and best known, style of pasta, and it's also one of the oldest. One cultural survey of Sicily from around 1154 mentions a precursor to spaghetti, dried strands of dough made from wheat flour, being exported to other regions of Italy. Another version called <em>spaghetti alla chitarra</em> originated in Abruzzo, where it was first made using a tool similar to a guitar (chitarra means guitar). The dough was placed on the chitarra then pushed through so that the strings cut the sheet of dough into strips.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strascinati:
<ul>
<li>Region: Basilicata &amp; Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Strascinati are very similar to orecchiette, just larger. Their name is derived from the verb strascinare, meaning to pull, because they are traditionally made by pulling small chunks of pasta dough over the baking boards (grooved boards are used for the ridged version of this pasta). Strascinati can be paired with simple tomato sauces and classic ragùs, or it can simply be flavored with fried breadcrumbs, anchovies, and peperoni cruschi.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strozzapreti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Emilia Romagna (northern Italy)</li>
<li>The name for these short twists translates as ''priest strangler''. Inspired by the legend that greedy priests would eat the strozzapreti, given to them by locals, so quickly that they might choke on it. Serve with light, smooth sauces that will cling to the twists, pesto would work well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trofie:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>These small, rolled pasta shapes are traditionally served the Genovese way with pesto, green beans and potatoes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Our organic "Penne Ziti" also called "Pene Lisce" durum wheat pasta is made in Italy for the most authentic taste. Durum wheat is the best wheat for pasta making.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who is "Pasta di Stigliano"?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pasta di Stigliano boasts an ancient tradition of industrious pasta makers who became famous even overseas with the name of "maccheronieri", who already from 1824 in Stigliano mixed with art and skill simple natural ingredients to create a fine pasta. The taste and quality of Pasta di Stigliano derives, today as then, from the careful selection of grains typical of our area, not genetically modified, including the famous "Senatore Capelli" and the "Saragolle Lucane" mixed with other hard grains Lucani. The slow drying at "low temperatures" and the "bronze drawing" guarantee a high quality pasta, tasty, genuine and above all digestible.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why is this pasta so white and not yellow like most pasta?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once pasta is formed it needs to be dried. 99% of all pasta is hot air dried at what is considered ''high temperatures'' 80-120deg C for a couple of hours. This caramelizes the starch in the wheat leading to the yellow color.</li>
<li>Caramelized foods just like BBQ or grilling is not considered very healthy and creates cancerigenic byproducts. The same goes for pasta.</li>
<li>''Pasta di Stigliano'' like other premium Italian pastas which are very rare in Canada are dried at ''low temperatures'' 40-45deg C for a couple of days. Yes, days!</li>
<li>This is why this premium pasta is more white. Other than the cancerigenic reason, low temperature drying gives a better texture, less rubbery and they also absorb flavors better.</li>
<li>To conclude, if you are looking for a healthy authentic Italian pasta, this is it.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are your different types of pasta?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conchiglie:
<ul>
<li>Region: Naples (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Conchiglie pronounced as "con-keel-yay" and also known as "seashells" or “shells”, is medium sized conch shaped pasta. This shell-shaped pasta holds sauces well and the ideal sauce bases of this pasta include meat sauces and tomato sauces. The name is derived from "conchiglia", an Italian word that means seashell. In fact, this word is similar in meaning with the English "conch", which has been derived from "konkhe", the Greek word for shell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fusilli:
<ul>
<li>Region: Southern Italy</li>
<li>The word fusilli presumably comes from Italian: fuso, meaning "spindle" but is commonly reffered to as "rotini". This classic fusilli is much larger than its fusilli paesani cousin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fusilli Paesani:
<ul>
<li>Region: Southern Italy</li>
<li>Made by wrapping strips of pasta around a thin rod and allowing it to dry out. The result is a spiral shape that resembles a spring or a corkscrew.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Linguine:
<ul>
<li>Region: Genoa &amp; Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>This long, thin, flat noodle resembles a flattened spaghetti. Because it comes from the coast, linguine is often paired with seafood, particularly clams. The name means ''little tongues''</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macaroni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Naples (southern Italy)</li>
<li>One of the oldest forms of pasta, "macaroni" comes from the Greeks, who established the colony of Neopolis (modern day Naples) between 2000 and 1000BC, and appropriated a local dish made from barley-flour pasta and water called "macaria", possibly named after a Greek goddess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Orecchiette:
<ul>
<li>Region: Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Orecchiette means “little ears”. It is shaped like a cup or a small bowl, which catches the sauce. One of the most popular ways to serve orecchiette is with broccoli rabe and sausage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paccheri:
<ul>
<li>Region: Campania (south-west Italy)</li>
<li>Paccheri is a smooth tube of pasta from Campania that likely originated in Naples. Its shape is sometimes compared to pieces of cut up garden hose. One origin legend says that Sicilian pasta-makers created paccheri to smuggle banned garlic cloves into Austria (known as Prussia at the time) in the 1600s where imported garlic had been banned, as the garlic fit neatly in the hollowed out tube of pasta.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Penne Rigate:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>Penne means quill or feather, perhaps due to the slated ends of this ridged, tube-shaped pasta. Though penne originated in Liguria, one of the most beloved recipes for penne, called arrabbiata, comes from Rome. Arrabbiata, meaning “angry,” is a spicy red sauce made with tomatoes, chili peppers, and garlic.</li>
<li>Penne Rigate is slightly shorter than Penne Ziti and is more rigid when cooked than Penne Ziti.</li>

Arrabbiata, meaning “angry,” is a spicy red sauce made with tomatoes, chili peppers, and garlic.</li>
<li>Penne Ziti is slightly longer than Penne Rigate is consistently smooth in texture. When cooked, it tends to turn soft and buttery, whereas penne retains more of its rigidity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raschiatelli (Cavatelli):
<ul>
<li>Region: Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>It has an elongated shape with an opening in the middle. It’s made by pressing a finger into the center of each piece of dough. The final result is a pasta that looks like a shell or a hot dog bun. The traditional Cavatelli is served with pork sausage ragu. This is a hearty substantial sauce based on pork ribs, sausages, and tomato pulp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rigatoni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Rome (central Italy)</li>
<li>The name for these short tubes of pasta comes from the word <em>rigato</em>, which means “ridged.” Though rigatoni is generally bigger than penne (and doesn’t have the curved ends) it can be cut in a variety of diameters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spaghettoni:
<ul>
<li>Region: Disputed (Sicily or Abruzzo)</li>
<li>Spaghettoni is a thicker version of the classic spaghetti pasta. Other than that it is pretty much the same.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spaghetti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Disputed (Sicily or Abruzzo)</li>
<li>Spaghetti might be the most popular, and best known, style of pasta, and it's also one of the oldest. One cultural survey of Sicily from around 1154 mentions a precursor to spaghetti, dried strands of dough made from wheat flour, being exported to other regions of Italy. Another version called <em>spaghetti alla chitarra</em> originated in Abruzzo, where it was first made using a tool similar to a guitar (chitarra means guitar). The dough was placed on the chitarra then pushed through so that the strings cut the sheet of dough into strips.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strascinati:
<ul>
<li>Region: Basilicata &amp; Puglia (southern Italy)</li>
<li>Strascinati are very similar to orecchiette, just larger. Their name is derived from the verb strascinare, meaning to pull, because they are traditionally made by pulling small chunks of pasta dough over the baking boards (grooved boards are used for the ridged version of this pasta). Strascinati can be paired with simple tomato sauces and classic ragùs, or it can simply be flavored with fried breadcrumbs, anchovies, and peperoni cruschi.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strozzapreti:
<ul>
<li>Region: Emilia Romagna (northern Italy)</li>
<li>The name for these short twists translates as ''priest strangler''. Inspired by the legend that greedy priests would eat the strozzapreti, given to them by locals, so quickly that they might choke on it. Serve with light, smooth sauces that will cling to the twists, pesto would work well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trofie:
<ul>
<li>Region: Liguria (northern Italy)</li>
<li>These small, rolled pasta shapes are traditionally served the Genovese way with pesto, green beans and potatoes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Storage Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing beats vacuum sealing for freshness.</li>
<li>Store below 15°C and &lt; 65% humidity.</li>
<li>Store in the dark as light degrades flavors.</li>
<li>Mason jars make great storage containers.</li>
<li>Can be frozen to prolong shelf life.</li>
