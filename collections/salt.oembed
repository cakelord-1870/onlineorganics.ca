It's a delicate, almost flaky salt. Additionally, this moisture content encourages the salt crystals to stick together on your tongue, causing the flavor to be perceived more intensely. That's another reason a little bit goes a long way.

Ordinary sea salt is made by evaporating seawater and then collecting the remaining salt into mounds.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis high cost means that it shouldn't be used as an ordinary seasoning. Instead, think of it as almost a garnish or condiment. A few crystals of fleur de sel sprinkled over a dish add a burst of flavor, visual appeal, and even texture. A little bit truly goes a long way.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOnce you've procured a stash of fleur de sel, you will want to use it carefully.
